## ❓ **Common Questions**

**Q: Why do I need to do this?**  
A: Your browser remembers you were denied before. This clears that memory.

**Q: Do I need to do this every time?**  
A: No! Only this first time. After that, you can use your normal browser.

**Q: Is this safe?**  
A: Yes! Private/Incognito mode is completely safe. It just doesn't save your browsing history.

**Q: What if it still doesn't work?**  
A: Email matej@mgms.eu with:
- Which browser you're using
- What happened when you tried
