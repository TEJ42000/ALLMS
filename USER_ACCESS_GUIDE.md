## ❓ **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Q: Why do I need to do this?**
A: Your browser remembered that you were previously denied access. We need to clear that memory so it checks again and sees that you now have access.

### **Q: Will I need to do this every time?**
A: No! Only this first time. After you log in successfully once, you can use the normal browser window from then on.

### **Q: What if it still doesn't work?**
A: Contact the administrator (matej@mgms.eu) and let them know. They can help troubleshoot further.

### **Q: Is the private/incognito window safe?**
A: Yes! It's completely safe. It just means your browser won't remember your history or cookies for that session.

### **Q: Can I use my phone or tablet?**
A: Yes! The same steps work on mobile browsers. Look for "New Incognito Tab" or "New Private Tab" in your mobile browser's menu.
