[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable the following checks (merged from both configs):
# C0103: Invalid name for constants (acceptable for module-level singletons)
# C0114: Missing module docstring
# C0115: Missing class docstring
# C0116: Missing function docstring
# C0209: Consider using f-string (we use % formatting for consistency with logging)
# C0301: Line too long (handled by formatter)
# C0303: Trailing whitespace (handled by formatter)
# C0305: Trailing newlines (handled by formatter)
# C0411: Wrong import order (handled by isort)
# E0213: Method should have "self" as first argument (Pydantic validators use cls)
# E0401: Import errors (dependencies not installed in CI)
# R0801: Similar lines in files (duplicate code - acceptable for topic lists)
# R0903: Too few public methods (Pydantic models don't need methods)
# R0914: Too many local variables (acceptable for scripts)
# R0915: Too many statements (acceptable for scripts)
# W0603: Using the global statement (acceptable for singleton pattern)
# W0611: Unused import (may be needed for re-exports)
# W0621: Redefining name from outer scope (common pytest fixture pattern)
# W0718: Broad exception caught (sometimes needed for catch-all handlers)
# W1203: Logging f-string interpolation (f-strings are fine in modern Python)
# W1309: F-string without interpolation (readability preference)
# W1514: Unspecified encoding (default utf-8 is usually fine)
