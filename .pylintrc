[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable the following checks:
# R0903: Too few public methods (Pydantic models don't need methods)
# E0401: Import errors (dependencies not installed in CI)
# E0213: Method should have "self" as first argument (Pydantic validators use cls)
# R0801: Similar lines in files (duplicate code - acceptable for topic lists)
# R0914: Too many local variables (acceptable for scripts)
# R0915: Too many statements (acceptable for scripts)
# W0603: Using the global statement (acceptable for singleton pattern)
# C0103: Invalid name for constants (acceptable for module-level singletons)
# C0209: Consider using f-string (we use % formatting for consistency with logging)
# W0621: Redefining name from outer scope (common pytest fixture pattern)
