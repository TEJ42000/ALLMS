fix: Restore automated code review workflow functionality

CRITICAL FIXES:
- Fixed GitHub workflow step ID bug preventing output passing
- Rewrote review comment parsing to handle actual Claude format
- Added comprehensive error handling and debugging

ISSUES RESOLVED:
1. GitHub Workflow Bug (.github/workflows/automated-review-cycle.yml:36)
   - Missing 'id: get-review' prevented step output access
   - Added id to enable proper output passing between steps

2. Broken Parsing Logic (scripts/automated_review_cycle.py:126-172)
   - Original line-by-line parsing couldn't handle Claude review format
   - Implemented regex-based section extraction
   - Now handles emoji markers (🔴⚠️ℹ️💡) and section headers
   - Properly extracts numbered issues (### 1., ### 2., etc.)

3. Poor Error Handling (scripts/automated_review_cycle.py:36-124)
   - Added specific error messages for 404, 401, and other HTTP errors
   - Added progress indicators during workflow wait
   - Added comment detection debugging output
   - Improved user feedback throughout execution

NEW FEATURES:
- --debug flag for verbose troubleshooting output
- --skip-wait flag to parse existing comments without waiting
- --timeout flag for custom workflow wait times (default: 600s)
- Better comment detection (claude[bot] and github-actions[bot])
- Progress indicators showing elapsed time and status
- Detailed PR information display (author, branch, SHA)

FILES MODIFIED:
- .github/workflows/automated-review-cycle.yml (1 line)
- scripts/automated_review_cycle.py (150+ lines)
- docs/AUTOMATED_REVIEW_WORKFLOW.md (updated)

FILES CREATED:
- docs/AUTOMATED_REVIEW_FIX_REPORT.md (comprehensive technical report)
- AUTOMATED_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md (quick reference guide)

TESTING:
✅ Successfully parsed PR #238 review comments
✅ Extracted 3 HIGH, 7 MEDIUM, 4 LOW priority issues
✅ Debug mode shows detailed execution flow
✅ Error handling provides clear, actionable messages

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:
✅ Fully backward compatible
✅ Default behavior unchanged
✅ New flags are optional
✅ Existing scripts continue to work

USAGE:
  # Quick test (recommended)
  python scripts/automated_review_cycle.py --pr 238 --skip-wait

  # Full workflow
  python scripts/automated_review_cycle.py --pr 238

  # Debug mode
  python scripts/automated_review_cycle.py --pr 238 --debug

See AUTOMATED_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md for complete usage guide.

Fixes automated review workflow that was non-functional due to
workflow configuration bug and parsing logic failures.
