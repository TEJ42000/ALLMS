# **Case Notes: Etsirk v. Germany (ECHR)**

## **Article 6(3)(e) ECHR - Right to Free Interpretation**

-----

## **📋 OVERVIEW**

This case teaches us **two fundamental concepts**:

1. **When does Article 6(2) and (3) ECHR apply?** (Scope of application)
1. **What does “free interpretation” mean?** (Substantive right)

-----

## **📖 THE FACTS**

**Who:** Mr. Etsirk, a Turkish man living in Germany who didn’t speak German well

**What happened:**

- Car accident → fined
- Appealed the fine → wanted court proceedings
- During trial → withdrew his appeal
- German district court sentenced him AND ordered him to pay:
  - Court costs
  - **Interpreter fees**

**His complaint:** Article 6(3)(e) ECHR says interpretation should be **FREE** - he shouldn’t have to pay!

## **⚖️ LEGAL ISSUE #1: Was There a “Criminal Charge”?**

### **Why this matters:**

Article 6(3)(e) only applies if someone is “**charged with a criminal offense**”

### **The Problem:**

Germany had **decriminalized** this traffic offense → classified it as “regulatory offense” (administrative, not criminal)

### **The Solution: AUTONOMOUS INTERPRETATION**

🔑 **KEY PRINCIPLE:** The ECHR decides what counts as “criminal” - **NOT national governments**

**Why?**

- If countries could decide themselves, they could simply decriminalize offenses
- Then Article 6(2) and (3) protections wouldn’t apply
- This would **undermine** the Convention’s purpose: protecting **minimum rights** of citizens

-----

## **🎯 THE ENGEL CRITERIA** *(Learn these!)*

### **How ECHR Determines “Criminal Charge”:**

#### **Criterion 1: Classification in National Law**

- Is it in the Criminal Code or criminal legislation?
- ✅ If YES → clearly criminal, Article 6 applies
- ❌ If NO → this is just a **starting point** (little weight), continue to Criterion 2

#### **Criterion 2: Nature of the Offense** *(Most complex)*

Ask these questions:

1. **Who does it apply to?**

- Everyone in society? → More likely criminal
- Specific professional group only? → More likely disciplinary (e.g., lawyers, judges)

1. **What’s the purpose of the sanction?**

- Retributive/punitive goal? → Criminal
- Deterrent purpose? → Criminal

1. **Comparative legal research:**

- How do other Member States classify this conduct?
- If vast majority treat it as **criminal** → likely criminal charge

#### **Criterion 3: Severity of Sanction** *(Decisive)*

🔑 **The Rule:** More severe the **possible** sanction → more likely criminal

**Indicators of criminal charge:**

- **Deprivation of liberty** (imprisonment possible)
- **Very high fines**

**Important:** Look at **MAXIMUM sentence** in legislation, NOT the actual sentence imposed

**Requirement:** Sanction must serve a **punitive purpose**

-----

## **📌 WHAT IS A “CHARGE”?**

**Definition (¶ 55):**

> “Official notification given to an individual by competent authority of an allegation that he committed a criminal offense”

**OR**

> “Other measures which carry the implication of such an allegation and substantially affect the suspect’s situation”

**In simple terms:** The moment you know/must be aware that you’re being investigated in a criminal procedure

-----

## **✅ APPLICATION TO ETSIRK CASE**

### **Criterion 1:** Classification under German law?

- **Regulatory offense** (decriminalized)
- Only a starting point → continue

### **Criterion 2:** Nature of offense?

**The Court found:**

- ✅ Criminal in **vast majority** of Member States
- ✅ Rule of **general character** (applies to undetermined group)
- ✅ Penalty serves **deterrent and punitive** purpose

**Result:** SO CLEAR that Court didn’t even need Criterion 3!

### **Conclusion to Legal Issue #1:**

**YES** - Article 6(3)(e) applies because there WAS a criminal charge

-----

## **⚖️ LEGAL ISSUE #2: Was Article 6(3)(e) Violated?**

### **The Text:**

> “Everyone charged with a criminal offense has the right… to have the **free** assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.”

### **Previous Case Law:**

Court cited: **Luedicke, Belkacem and Koç v. Germany**

**The Rule:**

- “**Free**” means FREE
- Article 6(3)(e) is an **ABSOLUTE RIGHT**
- **NO exceptions** allowed for interpretation costs

### **Application:**

Did Mr. Etsirk have to pay for interpretation? **YES**

### **Conclusion to Legal Issue #2:**

**VIOLATION** of Article 6(3)(e) ECHR

-----

## **💡 KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR EXAMS**

### **1. Two Separate Questions:**

- Applicability (Is there a criminal charge?)
- Violation (Was the right breached?)

### **2. Autonomous Interpretation:**

- ECHR decides what “criminal charge” means
- National classification is just starting point

### **3. The Engel Test (3 Criteria):**

1. National law classification
1. Nature of offense
1. Severity of sanction

### **4. Article 6(3)(e) is Absolute:**

- “Free” means completely free
- No exceptions for interpretation costs
- Applies throughout criminal proceedings

-----

## **🎓 PROFESSOR’S TIPS**

- **Exam strategy:** Always address applicability BEFORE discussing violation
- **Structure:** Follow ECHR judgment structure in your answers
- **Engel criteria:** Can be applied cumulatively OR separately (if one is decisive)
- **Comparative research:** ECHR often checks how other Member States handle similar issues
