# W2: Constitutional law {#w2-constitutional-law .unnumbered}

...is the part of public law which defines the organization of a certain
territory, e.g. the structure, roles, powers, branches (e.g.
legislative, executive, judiciary) of law within a state, as well as the
relationship between states and citizens.

## Constitutional law {#constitutional-law .unnumbered}

1.  Constitution (Kingdom of the Netherlands: The NL + Aruba + Curaçao +
    > Sint Maarten),

2.  Custom (e.g. the confidence rule - not written down),

3.  Case law (decisions of the Supreme Court).

-   not everything is in writing due to politics (needs to be flexible)

-   NL has a **monist** system → a treaty does not have to be
    > transformed into national law; if it contains needed provisions -
    > can be referred to immediately

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   provisions are binding after they are published (Art. 93 C.) and
    > rules regarding such publications are laid down by Act of
    > Parliament (Art. 95 C.)

## State {#state .unnumbered}

1.  a defined territory

2.  permanent population

3.  effective and independent authority / government, can exert
    > influence over a population

-   does **not** need to be recognized by other states in order to be a
    > state

### Unitary state

-   central government supreme, e.g. France

-   any subnational units exercise only powers delegated by their
    > central government

### Federation

-   a union of partially self-governing states / regions under a central
    > / federal government

-   The Kingdom of the NL, The US, Germany etc.

-   government has many more competences than in a confederation

### Confederation

-   supremacy of individual states that unite for a common action

-   marginal loss of sovereignty (Russia / Belarus); marginal
    > competences that are shared

-   competences exactly described; if not listed in a Constitution - do
    > not have it

### Presidential systems {#presidential-systems .unnumbered}

-   the head of the executive elected independently with a mandate of
    > his own

-   not accountable to Congress in the sense of confidence rule

-   whether Congress has confidence in him or not, the President stays
    > in power

### Parliamentary systems {#parliamentary-systems .unnumbered}

-   the head of the executive owes the continuation of his office to the
    > parliament and is accountable to parliament in the sense of
    > confidence rule

-   PMs / chancellors can be voted out of office via a parliamentary
    > *vote of no confidence*

### The (EU) Netherlands {#the-eu-netherlands .unnumbered}

1.  Constitutional monarchy (chapter 2 C.)

2.  Parliamentary democracy (chapter 3 C.)

3.  Decentralized unitary state (chapter 7 C.)

Dutch Constitution

-   'organic laws' ordered by the C. → implement instructions (Art.
    > 107 C. - DCC, PC etc.)

-   provisions: 'vertical' - 'horizontal' effect

-   Dutch Parliament bicameral (art. 57 C.)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Crown = King + ministers (art. 42(1) C.); ministerial responsibility
    > (art. 42(2) C.)

## Rule of law: rechtsstaat {#rule-of-law-rechtsstaat .unnumbered}

People and institutions within a country, state or community are
accountable to the same laws, including lawmakers and leaders → no one
is above the law.

### Separation of political powers (Trias Politica)

a.  **legislative** branch (Parliament & Government) - makes GBR
    > (statutes), art. 81 C.

-   Acts of Parliament - Parliament **and** Government

-   enactment of individual cases (decision), e.g. art. 28 C.

b.  **executive** branch (Government) - implements acts / statutes, art.
    > 97(2) & 131 C.

-   Government co-legislator

-   independent rule-making competence (administrative order - 'Order in
    > Council')

c.  **judicial** branch (Judiciary) - resolves disputes in the civil,
    > criminal and administrative courts, art. 112-113 C.

-   sometimes administrative functions

-   appoint legal guardian (decision) → executive, legislator = executor

The Netherlands has a functional separation of powers, but institutional
separation (powers performed by different organs) **not complete**.

US: system of checks and balances.

### Legality

1)  Generally binding regulations (GBR)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  written rule

b.  addressed to an indefinite number of people

c.  applicable in an indefinite number of cases

d.  binding → no deviation possible

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2)  Basis in law for state activities

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  negative activities: always, nulla poena sine lege (art. 16 C.)

b.  positive activities: increasingly, Fluoridation case

Legal basis in law: attribution ←→ delegation;

**Attribution** occurs on different levels (art. 81, 89, 127, 133 C.)

**Delegation** (& subdelegation):

-   transfers (original) power and responsibility to inferior public
    > body

-   explicit statutory basis needed

1.  Formal legislator → Road Traffic Act

2.  Government → Decree Alcohol Tests

3.  Minister → Regulation on Breath Analysis

\* Interpretation:

-   when article states only 'as laid down by Act of Parliament' - no
    > delegation allowed

-   when article states 'will be regulated' / 'pursuant to' / 'laid down
    > by or pursuant to' - delegation allowed

### Fundamental rights

1)  Constitution, chapter 1

2)  ECHR

3)  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (The UN)

4)  European Social Charter etc.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
A.  Classic / social fundamental rights

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  *Classic* fundamental rights ('negative')

-   state is **not allowed to** interfere, addressed to citizens:
    > enforceable in court

2.  *Social* fundamental rights ('positive')

-   state is ordered to **do its utmost** to realize these rights, not
    > enforceable

B.  Absolute / relative fundamental rights

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  *Absolute* fundamental rights

-   restrictions on exercise **not allowed**, e.g. prohibition of
    > torture (art. 3 ECHR)

2.  *Relative* fundamental rights

-   restrictions on exercise **allowed**

-   only **formal legislator** can restrict exercise of right

-   statutory basis required, often an Act of Parliament

-   legitimate aim: must be mentioned in provision

'**Horizontal effect**': when citizens uphold fundamental rights and
freedoms in civil relations regulated by private law, in conflicts inter
se

**Problem** with the horizontal effect: determining if the effect of
such fundamental rights is direct (they work per se), or indirect
(mediated through proper terms and norms of private law)

Manifestation act (Act of Parliament):

-   requires permit in advance at the mayor's office

-   when and how to safely profess belief

-   ban on protest in extreme situations

### Judicial review

-   Judicial independence (art. 117 C.)

    -   appointed for life by Royal Decree, legal status regulated by
        > statute

    -   grounds for termination of appointment: resignation, pensionable
        > age (70 y/o), suspension or dismissal by the Supreme Court

-   Prohibition of constitutional review statutes (review: art. 120 C.)

-   Backdoor method: superior rules (review: art. 94 C.) - Acts of
    > Parliament can be reviewed through treaty law

Countries with constitutional review:

1.  USA - any court

2.  Germany - Bundesverfassungsgericht

3.  France - Conseil Constitutionnel

## Polity {#polity .unnumbered}

### Democracy {#democracy .unnumbered}

Direct (Ancient Greece, Referenda) and indirect (e.g. right to vote,
sometimes referendum etc.)

Presidential democracy: head of government = head of state

Parliamentary democracy: head of government not head of state (e.g. the
NL, UK)

### Parliament / States-General {#parliament-states-general .unnumbered}

1.  Second Chamber - 150 members, direct elections

2.  First Chamber - 75 members, indirect elections via provincial
    > council

-   represent all the Dutch (art. 50 C.) → political supremacy with the
    > 2nd Chamber

Parliamentary system:

-   right of interpellation (debate an issue, art. 68 C.)

-   right to approve and amend a budget (art. 105 C.)

-   ministers accountable to Parliament, not to King

-   '**motion of no confidence**' / 'confidence rule' - ministers who
    > can no longer count on parliamentary confidence must resign,
    > irrespective of if they still enjoy the King's support

### Local democracy {#local-democracy .unnumbered}

-   provincial & municipal councils, direct elections, proportional
    > representation

-   Dutch polity does not allow for elected prime minister, mayor,
    > judge, district attorney

-   legally binding referenda

### Dutch Monarchy {#dutch-monarchy .unnumbered}

-   chapter 2 C. - the King; art. 24 - House of Orange-Nassau

-   1815: constitutional monarchy, 1840s decline of royal power;

    -   criminal ministerial responsibility (art. 42 C.)

    -   requirement of countersignature (art. 47 C.)

    -   1848: political ministerial responsibility; symbolic position
        > King (art. 42 C.) → led to the development of the confidence
        > rule!

-   King of the NL - no real power: only right to be consulted, to
    > encourage and to warn

-   institutional monarchy - power of monarchy limited by the
    > Constitution, King is bound by the law (art. 35 C.)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  legal / juridical act → intended legal consequence

#### Types of orders (1:3(2) GALA) {#types-of-orders-132-gala .unnumbered}

##### Orders of a general nature

a.  **general binding regulations** - 3:1 and 1:3(2) GALA

-   different from constitutional law!

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   general rule, repeatable, no deviation possible, independent
    > regulation

-   GBRs from a formal legislator not an order → formal legislator
    > [≠]{.mark} AA (1:1-2(a) GALA)

    a.  **administrative measures**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   general and specific, no independent legal character (needs GBR);
    > fills in range of GBR

-   example: prohibition in bylaw (GBR), e.g. municipal bylaw; placing
    > relevant traffic signs in applicable zones (measure)

    a.  **policy rules** - 1:3(4) GALA, deviation: art. 4:84 GALA

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   general rule for weighing of interests, determining facts,
    > interpreting statutory legislation

-   similar to GBRs; discretion: instruction for civil servants

-   binding if rules are made public

##### Orders not of a general nature

a.  **administrative decision** (individual) - 1:3(2) GALA

-   a specific person/object; creates right/duty or changes of legal
    > status; (un)favorable

    a.  **rejection** of application or an administrative decision

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   equals a decision, 1:3(2) GALA → defined as there is no legal
    > consequences

### **Enforcement & sanctioning**

#### Reparatory 

(ending an illegal situation)

a.  **coercive action**

-   instruction with threat of physical intervention + deadline

-   after time limit → cost reparation for wrongdoer

-   5:1, 5:2(1)(b), 5:21 GALA

b.  **coercive penalty payment**

-   instruction under threat of paying sum of money + deadline

-   after time limit → collection of forfeited sum

-   5:1, 5:2(1)(b), 5:31(d) GALA; alternative: 5:32 GALA

#### Punitive 

(inflicting distress, penalizing)

-   **administrative fine**; direct (unconditional) obligation to pay
    > sum of money

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   art. 5:40 par. 1 GALA

-   no judicial intervention beforehand but access to court afterwards →
    > art. 6 ECHR

### **Principles of good governance**

-   limits power of public body / AA

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   general principles of proper administration

-   not all codified in GALA (e.g. administrative principle of equality,

## Procedural administrative law {#procedural-administrative-law .unnumbered}

### Invoking legal protection in administrative courts  {#invoking-legal-protection-in-administrative-courts .unnumbered}

**3 requirements**:

1.  Appealable / contestable orders (8:3 GALA)

-   administrative decision (including refusal) and administrative
    > measures

-   always check - is it a **valid order** in the first place? 1:3(1)
    > GALA

-   other orders: appealable to civil courts (e.g. policy rules)

2.  Who can appeal?

-   (in)directly interested party (1:2 GALA) - interest is directly
    > affected by an order;

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   directly interested party: addressee of the order (person/object),
    > recipient of right/duty

-   interested third party: concern should be:

1)  own → not caretaker

2)  personal → distinguishable from mass

3)  objective → not merely emotional

4)  current → not dependent on future events

5)  directly linked to decision → causal connection

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  Preliminary: **notice of objection**

-   Administrative authority takes original decision

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   interested party objects to 1st decision

\*offer may be subject to the fulfillment of a condition (e.g. time
limit making it irrevocable)

**Revocable offer**: An offer is revocable, unless there is evidence to
the contrary (e.g. it mentions a term / date); the offeror will not be

c.  *juridical* acts: freedom of contract → more *default* rules

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
2)  **Juridical act**: *intention* to invoke legal rules

-   e.g. drawing up the last will, entering into a contract of sale etc.

    > relinquishes ownership of his item in exchange for an agreed
    > counter-performance thereby forfeits the chance that the item may
    > later prove to have characteristics he was unaware of at the time
    > of sale'

-   claim of **error** still possible, but extra circumstances required

###  {#section-4 .unnumbered}

### Mistake {#mistake .unnumbered}

-   'will' ≠ 'statement'; problem with offer and acceptance

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Italian Zoo case: 'one or two monkeys' → '1 o 2' → '102'

### **Void acts** {#void-acts .unnumbered}

-   invalid, not enforceable (art. 3:40 DCC)

-   contrary to public policy and law: e.g. testament not passed before

    > cannot be repaired, juridical act not enforced

### **Voidable acts** {#voidable-acts .unnumbered}

-   result of vitiated consent: enforceable and valid unless challenged
    > (art. 3:44 DCC)

```{=html}

    > **annulment**

a.  **error** (6:228 DCC)

'misunderstanding or lack of relevant information'

-   only invoked in reciprocal contracts; circumstances for annulment:

1.  error as a result of information given by the other party

2.  opposing party should have informed the party making the error of
    > what he knew

3.  mutual error, both parties are in error (the painting case)

-   exceptions (6:228(2) DCC)

b.  **threat** (3:44(2) DCC)

-   Haviltex case: grammatical interpretation does not suffice, have to
    > interpret beyond the wording; look at other conditions, e.g.
    > social circles

-   reasonableness and equity (6:248 DCC): supplementary function ←→
    > restrictive;

    -   supplementary effect: e.g. when there's a gap in the contract
        > (an indefinite period of time → can then be terminated)

    -   restrictive effect: condition in a contract is made inoperative
        > (circumstances can bar a contracting party from invoking the

-   force majeure, performance *not possible*

-   main rule (art. 6:74(1) DCC) and exception (art. 6:75 DCC)

#### **Imputable** 

1)  Performance still *possible*:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  demand performance (3:296 DCC)

-   creditor still **appreciates performance**

-   reverse: contingency exception (art. 6:263 DCC)

c.  rescind contract (6:265 DCC)

-   creditor wants to **dissolve contract**

d.  damages (6:74(1) DCC)

-   default first necessary (6:82 DCC), exception:

-   immediate default (6:83 DCC);

    -   term for payment already lapsed

    -   obligation results from an unlawful act

    -   creditor has reason to conclude that debtor will fail to perform
        > even with the notice of default

-   additional damages (6:85 DCC) - for delay in performance

-   alternative (6:87 DCC) - creditor wants compensation instead of
    > performance

2)  Performance *not possible*: damages

-   compensation can be claimed immediately (6:74(2) DCC)

```{=html}

### Ways states can claim sovereignty over a territory {#ways-states-can-claim-sovereignty-over-a-territory .unnumbered}

1.  discovery

2.  occupation

3.  prescription

## Origin of international law {#origin-of-international-law .unnumbered}

States need to coexist; international peace and security

Global wars → expansion of international law (modern technology,
environmental issues, human rights)

Why states comply with international law:

1.  **The need for coexistence**; sense of (international)
    > responsibility and preventing conflicts

2.  **(Common) self-interest**; maintaining the possibility of obtaining
    > foreign aid and maintaining good relationships with other states
    > to enable financial benefits etc.

3.  **Political cost**; economic sanctions

4.  **Psychological barrier**; the psychological element in the need to
    > comply with laws

5.  **Habit of obedience**

## Subjects of international law {#subjects-of-international-law .unnumbered}

### States

Criteria for 'states':

a.  defined territory

b.  permanent population

c.  effective, independent authority

Alternative criteria (Montevideo Convention, art. 1):

a.  defined territory

b.  permanent population

c.  government

d.  capacity to enter into relations with other states

Recognition by other states does not matter! (Montevideo Convention,
art. 3)

### International organizations

a.  Intergovernmental

-   no transfer of sovereignty

-   decisions by unanimity

-   example: the UN, African Union

b.  Supranational

-   transfer (giving up) of sovereignty

-   decisions by majority

-   example: the EU

### Individuals

a.  Human rights

-   ICCPR (Civil and Political Rights)

-   ICESCR (Economic, Social and Cultural Rights)

-   ECHR (European Convention of Human Rights)

b.  Human duties

-   criminal liability

-   international crimes (e.g. genocide and war crimes)

## Sources of international law {#sources-of-international-law .unnumbered}

### **Primary sources**

(a, b & c are stated in Article 38 SICJ)

#### Treaties

(international conventions)

-   consent needed! - principle of voluntarism; States can only be bound
    > with treaties to which they explicitly agreed

-   written agreements

    -   between states (and / or international organizations)

    -   governed by international law

    -   bilateral / multilateral

#### *Creation of treaties* {#creation-of-treaties .unnumbered}

1.  **Signing** → party to the treaty (not yet enough)

2.  **Ratification** / **accession** → consent to be bound

-   ratification - states which were present when the treaties were
    > constructed

-   accession - states which join later

3.  Treaty enters into force if **enough States consent** to be bound

International law

-   1969 VCLT

-   pacta sunt servanda (Art. 26)

-   international customary law

#### Custom

1.  **Usus** ('sufficiently widespread and uniform' practice) -
    > objective

2.  **Opinio iuris** (belief that it was carried out as a legal
    > obligation) - subjective

Examples:

-   Diplomatic immunity (and what it entails) → Vienna Convention on
    > Diplomatic Relations

-   Law of the sea → UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)

Custom can become treaty law:

-   Custom - territorial waters: reach of cannons (3 miles); moved to 12
    > miles

-   UNCLOS - took effect in 1994; territorial sea up to 12 miles

\*Example of custom: Caroline test of determining whether self-defense
is justified; elements needed - proportionality and subsidiarity

#### General principles of law

-   implemented when no treaty or custom exists

-   common in almost all legal systems

Examples:

1.  good faith - nuclear test case (1974)

2.  abuse of power

3.  reparation

#### Binding decisions of international organizations

-   not stated in Art. 38 SICJ

-   e.g. Security Council of the United Nations (art. 25 UN Charter)

-   the fact that decisions are binding adds a supranational factor to
    > the UN (except to the permanent members)

### Hierarchy {#hierarchy .unnumbered}

There is no formal hierarchy among categories of sources; **however**:

1.  In a conflict of treaties, the UN Charter prevails over other
    > international sources (Art. 103 UN Charter)

2.  Peremptory norms, ius cogens, always take precedence;

-   norms that are so important that they cannot be derogated from if
    > there's a conflict with other obligations; e.g. prohibition from
    > torture, genocide etc.

-   any treaty which is not concluded in accordance with ius cogens is
    > automatically void, according to Art. 53 VCLT

### **Subsidiary sources**

(stated in art. 38 SICJ)

#### Judicial decisions

#### Writings of legal publicists

## Implementing international law {#implementing-international-law .unnumbered}

#  {#section-5 .unnumbered}

#### Monism / incorporation

-   international law has direct force in national law as international
    > law

-   issue: surrender of sovereignty, less control over national law

#### Dualism / transformation

-   transformation of international law into national system as national
    > law

-   issue: unclear hierarchy of legislation when international law is
    > made national; all legislation becomes national law → need to
    > apply lex posterior derogat legi priori; problem as newer national
    > law may conflict with international obligations! → always check
    > that the newer national law abides by previous international
    > obligations

### **Jurisdiction** {#jurisdiction .unnumbered}

**Jurisdiction** - a state's competence to make and enforce rules in
respect to persons, property or events, which may be exercised in 3
ways:

1.  legislation (legislature)

2.  adjudication (courts)

3.  enforcement (police or armed forces)

**Extraterritorial** enforcement action strictly prohibited by
international law unless consented to by the territorial state;
legislation and adjudication required.

**Territorial** jurisdiction: states exercise exclusive jurisdiction on
their own territories.

Other ways a state can claim jurisdiction:

1.  **Nationality** principle;

    a.  active: a state may exercise over persons with its nationality

    b.  passive: state may exercise over conduct abroad that injures its
        > nationals

2.  **Protective** principle: state may exercise over persons who
    > threaten its vital interests by preparing a coup d'etat

3.  **Universality** principle: a state may / must exercise over certain
    > serious crimes, irrespective of the location of the crime and
    > nationality of the perpetrator / victim

4.  **Effects** principle: state may exercise when foreign conduct
    > produces substantial effects on its territory

**Concurrent** jurisdiction - 2 or more states have jurisdiction over a
particular offense → the state most likely to prosecute the offender is
the state having custody over him.

**Rendition** - sending an alleged criminal to another state for
investigation / prosecution in the absence of an extradition treaty.

#### Immunities from jurisdiction {#immunities-from-jurisdiction .unnumbered}

1.  principle of sovereign equality of states - official representatives
    > of one state should not be subject to the jurisdiction of another
    > state

2.  principle of state / sovereign immunity - foreign sovereigns enjoy
    > immunity from the jurisdiction of other states

3.  principle of diplomatic immunity - diplomatic agents of the sending
    > state have complete immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the
    > receiving state (immunity belongs to the sending state and not the
    > diplomat → can be waived by sending state)

    > state

-   e.g. the right to life, prohibition against torture, fair trial,
    > freedom of expression, vote

-   enshrined in general human rights instruments (UDHR, ICCPR, ECHR)
    > and require the state to abstain from interfering with the
    > enjoyment of these rights

-   require immediate realization by states (art. 2 ICCPR)

#### Economic, social and cultural rights

-   safeguard the individual's socio-economic well-being, cultural
    > identity and freedom

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   e.g. right to work and adequate working conditions, social security,
    > education...

-   sometimes call for abstention by states as well, e.g. the right to
    > strike

-   permit progressive rather than immediate realization

-   entail an obligation of conduct (taking steps) rather than
    > obligation of result

#### Collective rights

-   belong to certain groups considered to be vulnerable and in need of
    > special protection

-   e.g. right to self-determination of people, land rights for
    > Indigenous people, right to a healthy environment, somewhat
    > intangible right to development

-   cannot be claimed by individual members of that group, only by the
    > group as a whole

-   some human rights that are essentially collective in nature are
    > sometimes invoked as individual rights in practice; e.g. right to
    > a healthy environment in the Urgenda case
