## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES

**Central Paradox:**
- Enlightenment ideal: Judges as "mouths of the law"
- Reality: ALL texts require interpretation

**Formal vs. Material:**
- Formal = HOW law is made
- Material = WHAT law says (must be just)

**Radbruch Formula:**
- "Extremely unjust law is not law at all"

**Legality Principle:**
- *Nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege*
- No crime, no punishment without law

---

1. **Introduction** - State the legal question
2. **Legal Framework** - Explain applicable rules/principles
3. **Application** - Apply rules to specific facts
4. **Reasoning** - Show interpretation method used
5. **Conclusion** - Clear answer to the question

### What Professors Want to See:
- ✅ Understanding of HOW judges interpret (not just WHAT rules say)
