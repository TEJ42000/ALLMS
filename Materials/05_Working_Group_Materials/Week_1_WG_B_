-----

## **I. ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS & COURSE EXPECTATIONS**

### **Study Tools & Preparation**

- **Slim Stompin Tool:** Strongly recommended for memorizing cases
  - Great way to memorize the extensive case law required for the exam
  - Early start makes exam preparation significantly easier
  - Critical given the volume of cases to learn

### **Working Group Expectations**

- Students should prepare by watching web videos (minimum requirement)
- Videos provide excellent summaries of cases
- Working group format: discussion-based, not lecture-based
- Safe space for collaboration and stepping outside comfort zones
- No judgment from instructor or peers

### **Exam Structure**

- **Part A:** Substantive criminal law (more concrete/objective)
- **Part B:** ECHR and procedural law (more abstract/subjective)
- Exam timeline: approximately 2 months away
- Format includes:
  - Practice questions (like those in workgroup)
  - Theoretical questions from Dr. Peters’ Wednesday lectures

-----

## **II. ÖZTÜRK V. GERMANY - CRIMINAL CHARGE ASSESSMENT**

### **Case Background**

**Mr. Öztürk’s Situation:**

- Appeared before Heidelberg district court
- Entered appeal against Bill of Costs regarding interpreter’s fee
- Relied on Article 6 ECHR and prior ECtHR judgment establishing free interpretation as an absolute right

### **Role of European Commission on Human Rights**

- **Historical Context (1954-1998):**
  - Acted as intermediary between individuals and European Court
  - Individuals had no direct access to ECtHR
  - Commission assessed whether cases were well-founded
  - If yes, launched cases at ECtHR on behalf of individuals
- **Protocol 11 (1998):**
  - Abolished the Commission
  - Enlarged the Court
  - Gave individuals direct access to ECtHR

### **Key Legal Question:**

**Why does the ECtHR use autonomous interpretation of “criminal charge”?**

**Answer:** To prevent states from circumventing Article 6 and 7 protections by simply reclassifying criminal offenses as administrative or regulatory offenses. If domestic lawmakers could exclude fundamental protections through domestic classification alone, this would subordinate the Convention’s application to state sovereignty, creating results incompatible with the Convention’s goals.

### **THE THREE-PART ENGEL CRITERIA (Criminal Charge Assessment)**

#### **1. Classification Under Domestic Law**

- Starting point only
- Carries relatively little weight
- Important to examine first
- If already classified as criminal domestically → no problem with Article 6 applicability
- If classified as administrative → still may be “criminal” under Article 6

#### **2. Nature of the Offense**

**Two Key Questions:**

1. **To whom is the norm addressed?**

- Everyone = indicator of criminal nature
- Restricted group = may not be criminal
- *Examples of restricted groups:* military personnel, specific professions, academic institutions

1. **What is the purpose of the sanction?**

- Must primarily serve **retributive/punitive goal**
- Aimed at punishment

**Important Note:** When in doubt about nature, ECtHR tends to apply this factor in favor of the applicant

#### **3. Nature and Degree of Severity of Sanction**

- **Most decisive criterion**
- Rule of thumb: **More severe sanction = more likely criminal**
- Look at **maximum penalty in legislation**, NOT actual sentence imposed
- Example: If defendant gets 5 years but maximum is 20 years → consider the 20 years

**Severe Sanctions Include:**

- Any deprivation of liberty (violates Article 2 right to life)
- High pecuniary sanctions placing immense burden on defendant

-----

### **Definition of “Charge”**

**“Charge” means:** The official notification given to an individual by a competent authority of an allegation that they have committed a specific crime

**Can take various forms:**

- Formal summons
- Arrest
- Any official notification
- When accused is “substantially affected” by authorities’ conduct

-----

### **Öztürk Outcome Discussion**

**Question:** Do you agree with the right to free interpreter for a trial regarding objection to a fine of approximately 25 euros?

**Arguments FOR:**

- **Principle-based:** Article 6(3)(e) provides right to free interpretation assistance
- Individual rights shouldn’t be limited by monetary value
- Without understanding the language, defense rights are drastically hampered
- Interpretation as an absolute right

**Arguments AGAINST:**

- Efficiency concerns
- Interpreter costs (€60) exceeded the fine itself (€25)
- Total costs to Mr. Öztürk: approximately €85

**ECtHR Position:**

- Interpretation fees CANNOT be charged (absolute right under Article 6(3)(e))
- Other court costs CAN be charged to convicted defendants
- Article 6 does NOT claim entire proceeding is free
- Under German law, losing defendant pays other court costs

-----

## **III. VENDITTELLI V. ITALY - REASONABLE TIME REQUIREMENT**

### **Rationale for Reasonable Time Requirement**

**Purpose:** Ensure individuals don’t lie under a charge for too long and that charges are determined as quickly as possible

**Impact of Prolonged Proceedings:**

- Considerable strain on the accused
- Uncertainty about the future
- Fear of conviction
- Threat of sanction of unknown severity

### **Vendittelli Case Timeline**

- **Start:** 20 May 1986 (Rome magistrate upheld seals on Mr. Vendittelli’s flats; criminal proceedings instituted)
- **End:** 30 October 1989 (Court of Appeal decision became final and enforceable)
- **Duration:** 4 years, 5 months, 10 days

### **ECtHR Finding**

**NO VIOLATION** of reasonable time requirement

**Reasoning:**

1. Case was not particularly complex
1. **Vendittelli’s conduct:** He bears partial responsibility

- Sought two adjournments causing ~6-month delay
- Out of 14 total months, 6-month delay is significant

1. **Authorities’ conduct:** Took 11 months to notify decision, BUT Vendittelli was physically present and could have obtained copy immediately

-----

### **FOUR-PART REASONABLE TIME ASSESSMENT**

#### **Step 1: Establish Relevant Time Period**

**Starting Point (criminal proceedings begin when):**

- Individual officially charged, OR
- Earlier: time of arrest, OR
- Opening of preliminary investigations that substantially affect individual’s life

**Ending Point:**

- **INCLUDES APPEAL PROCEEDINGS**
- Final judgment becomes enforceable
- If case brought to Court of Appeal → end is when Appeal Court judgment is finalized

**Calculate overall duration**

-----

#### **Step 2: Assess Reasonableness Using Four Criteria**

**1. COMPLEXITY OF THE CASE**
Delays may be justified when case involves:

- Multiple defendants
- International dimension/transnational elements
- Multiple charges pending
- Complex evidence gathering

**Example Comparison:**

- Simple: 20-year-old accused of theft from supermarket (one defendant, domestic)
- Complex: 5 defendants aged 18-32 in drug smuggling operation across Europe

-----

**2. CONDUCT OF THE APPLICANT**

- Defendants NOT required to speed up proceedings
- BUT cannot unnecessarily delay or obstruct

**Acceptable:**

- Using all available legal remedies
- Legitimate defense strategies

**Problematic (Unnecessary Obstruction):**

- Being a fugitive
- Not showing up to court dates
- Systematically challenging judges without merit
- Threshold exists where legal remedy use becomes excessive

-----

**3. CONDUCT OF THE AUTHORITIES**

- States must organize court systems effectively and efficiently
- Some delays justified
- **Heavy workloads or backlogs usually NOT sufficient justification**
- Long periods of inexcusable inactivity = problem

-----

**4. WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR THE DEFENDANT**

- More serious consequences = more urgent resolution needed
- Prevents defendant from lying under charge too long
- Consider: severity of potential punishment, impact on defendant’s life

-----

### **Important Note on Reasonable Time**

Violations can occur in **BOTH directions:**

- **Too long:** Most common violation
- **Too short:** Highly complex case resolved in only 2 months could also violate reasonable time requirement (raises doubts about effectiveness and thoroughness of proceedings)

-----

## **IV. STUDY METHODOLOGY & EXAM PREPARATION**

### **What to Memorize**

**YOU NEED TO KNOW:**

- Assessment frameworks/models
- Case law references for each legal principle
- Rules derived from cases
- How to apply rules to hypothetical facts

**YOU DON’T NEED TO MEMORIZE:**

- Specific case facts in detail
- Articles of ECHR (provided at exam)
- Paragraph numbers from judgments

### **Making Connections (Instructor’s Recommended Study Method)**

**Example Structure:**

```
Article 6 ECHR
↓
Right to Fair Trial
↓
Reasonable Time Requirement
↓
Case Law: Vendittelli v. Italy
↓
Four-Part Assessment:
1. Establish relevant time period
2. Complexity of case
3. Conduct of applicant
4. Conduct of authorities
5. What was at stake
```

**Benefits:**

- When you see exam question, immediately know which case and assessment model to use
- Build these mental connections early
- Slim Stompin tool helps reinforce connections

-----

### **IRAC Method Application**

**For Criminal Charge Assessment Questions:**

**ISSUE:** Is there a criminal charge? / Is Article 6 applicable?

**RULE:**

- Article 6 only applicable if criminal charge exists
- Case Law: Öztürk v. Germany
- Three-part Engel Criteria:

1. Classification under domestic law (starting point, little weight)
1. Nature of offense (addressed to everyone? punitive purpose?)
1. Nature and degree of severity of sanction (maximum penalty in legislation)

**APPLICATION:**

- Apply each criterion to facts
- Look at relevant domestic legislation provided
- Analyze each element systematically

**CONCLUSION:**

- Is there a criminal charge? Yes/No
- Therefore Article 6 is/is not applicable

-----

**For Reasonable Time Requirement Questions:**

**ISSUE:** Has the reasonable time requirement been violated?

**RULE:**

- Article 6(1) reasonable time requirement
- Case Law: Vendittelli v. Italy
- Step 1: Establish relevant time period (start to end)
- Step 2: Four-part assessment (complexity, applicant conduct, authority conduct, what’s at stake)

**APPLICATION:**

- Identify start date and what happened
- Identify end date and what happened
- Calculate duration
- Apply four criteria to facts
- Analyze whether delays justified

**CONCLUSION:**

- Has reasonable time requirement been violated? Yes/No
- Why or why not based on analysis

-----

## **V. PRACTICE QUESTIONS - WORKED EXAMPLES**

### **Practice Question 1: Demonstration Case**

**Facts:** Applicant holding demonstration; charged with administrative offense

**Question:** Are Article 6(2) and (3) applicable?

**Analysis:**

- **Trigger word:** “Applicable” → assess if criminal charge exists
- **Issue:** Is there a criminal charge requiring Article 6 applicability?
- **Rule:** Öztürk v. Germany three-part test

**Application to Facts:**

1. **Classification:** Administrative offense under domestic law (Article 185)

- Does NOT automatically exclude Article 6

1. **Nature of offense:**

- Addressed to everyone (general nature) ✓
- Sanction serves punitive goal ✓

1. **Severity of sanction:**

- Maximum: Administrative detention up to 15 days
- Deprivation of liberty = severe sanction ✓

**Conclusion:** YES, this is a criminal charge → Article 6(2) and (3) ARE applicable

-----

### **Practice Question 2: Reasonable Time - First Case**

**Facts:**

- 13 October 2010: Invited to police station
- 29 October 2010: Appeal Court decision finalized
- Simple/straightforward case

**Question:** Has reasonable time requirement been violated?

**Analysis:**

- **Start:** 13 October 2010 (invited to police station)
- **End:** 29 December 2010 (Appeal Court judgment final)
- **Duration:** 2 months and 16 days

**Four-Part Assessment:**

1. **Complexity:** NOT complex (straightforward, minor offense)
1. **Applicant conduct:** No delays or obstruction
1. **Authority conduct:** No significant delays
1. **Stake:** [Not heavily emphasized in discussion]

**Conclusion:** NO VIOLATION - Two months and 16 days is reasonable for a straightforward case

**Important Teaching Point:**

- No strict time threshold exists
- Case-by-case assessment by ECtHR
- Must argue substantively using framework
- Different reasonable arguments possible if well-supported

-----

### **Practice Question 3: Mobile Phone Smuggling Case**

**Facts:**

- 14 January 1998: Applicant arrested (during police interview)
- 14 January 2006: Appeal Court judgment final
- Minor offense (smuggling single mobile phone to prison)
- Two co-defendants

**Question:** Has reasonable time requirement been violated?

**Analysis:**

- **Duration:** 8 years

**Four-Part Assessment:**

1. **Complexity:** NOT particularly complex

- Minor offense
- Only 2 co-defendants (represented by same counsel)
- Evidence-taking caused no problems
- No international complications

1. **Applicant conduct:** NO delays or obstruction

- Defense did not delay proceedings

1. **Authority conduct:** YES, significant delays

- Nearly **2 years** between Bill of Indictment and opening of main proceedings (extremely long)
- Other lengthy periods acknowledged by regional court and government
- Compensation: Only 2-week reduction in pre-sentence detention
- 2 weeks completely disproportionate to 8-year total duration

1. **Stake:** Prison sentence at stake; salary reduction

**Conclusion:** **YES, VIOLATION** of Article 6(1) - Authorities’ conduct with long, inexcusable periods of inactivity over 8 years is unreasonable for a minor, straightforward offense

-----

## **VI. KEY TAKEAWAYS & FINAL ADVICE**

### **Critical Points to Remember**

1. **Autonomous Interpretation Principle:**

- States cannot exclude Article 6/7 by simply reclassifying offenses
- ECtHR independently determines what constitutes “criminal”

1. **Assessment Models Are Key:**

- Memorize frameworks, not case facts
- Know which case law applies to which legal principle
- Practice applying models to hypotheticals

1. **Relevant Domestic Legislation:**

- Always provided for a reason
- Don’t skip it - contains crucial information for answers

1. **IRAC Method:**

- Issue: What is the legal question?
- Rule: What case law and assessment model applies?
- Application: Apply framework to specific facts
- Conclusion: Answer the question asked

1. **Trigger Words in Questions:**

- “Applicable” → Assess if criminal charge exists
- “Violated” → Assess if rights were breached
- Pay attention to what’s actually being asked

1. **Case-by-Case Assessment:**

- ECtHR uses cumulative, subjective analysis
- No strict thresholds or black-and-white rules
- Well-argued positions receive credit even if different from model answer
- Must support arguments with facts and framework

1. **Exam Preparation:**

- Start using Slim Stompin early
- Build mental connections between articles, principles, cases, and rules
- Practice, practice, practice with hypotheticals
- Don’t underestimate Part B - it’s abstract and challenging
