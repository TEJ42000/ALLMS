Criminal Law Study Notes

**Defenses - Justifications & Excuses**

*Course: Criminal Law Part A*

🎯 LEARNING OBJECTIVES

By the end of these notes, you should be able to:

-   Distinguish between justifications and excuses within the tripartite
    framework

-   Apply the criteria for self-defense to hypothetical scenarios

-   Understand how defenses operate at different stages of criminal
    liability

-   Recognize when prior fault defeats a defense

-   Analyze self-defense excess situations

I. FUNDAMENTAL DISTINCTION: JUSTIFICATIONS VS. EXCUSES

The Core Difference (MEMORIZE THIS!)

**Justification:** \"We accept responsibility but deny that it was bad\"

**Excuse:** \"We admit it was bad but don\'t accept full (or any)
responsibility\"

Examples to Illustrate

**Justification Example** (Self-Defense):

-   *Scenario:* Someone is about to kill you, so you wound them first

-   *Your position:* \"Yes, I did it, and what I did was RIGHT given the
    circumstances\"

-   *Legal effect:* The act was **lawful/justified** - no wrongdoing
    occurred

**Excuse Example** (Insanity):

-   *Scenario:* You kill someone because you believe aliens ordered you
    to do so

-   *Your position:* \"Yes, I did it, and it was wrong, but you can\'t
    blame ME because I\'m mentally ill\"

-   *Legal effect:* The act was **wrongful** but you\'re not
    **blameworthy**

II\. WHERE DEFENSES OPERATE IN THE TRIPARTITE FRAMEWORK

The Tripartite Framework Review

**Stage 1: LEGAL ELEMENTS**

-   Actus Reus (objective elements)

-   Mens Rea (subjective elements)

> *↓ \[Only proceed if Stage 1 fulfilled\]*

**Stage 2: UNLAWFULNESS**

-   Are there JUSTIFICATIONS? (Self-defense, Necessity, State Order)

> *↓ \[Only proceed if no justification\]*

**Stage 3: CULPABILITY**

-   Are there EXCUSES? (Duress, Insanity, Self-defense Excess,
    Provocation, Mistake of Law, Intoxication)

Critical Rules for Using the Framework

-   **STOP when a stage is not fulfilled** - don\'t continue analyzing

-   **Justifications operate at Stage 2** (Unlawfulness)

-   **Excuses operate at Stage 3** (Culpability/Blameworthiness)

-   **Never skip stages or analyze out of order**

III\. SELF-DEFENSE (JUSTIFICATION - STAGE 2)

Dutch Criminal Code Article 41(1)

*\"He who commits an act where this is necessary in the defense of his
person or the person of another, his or another person\'s integrity or
property, against an imminent unlawful attack, is not criminally
liable.\"*

The Seven Criteria for Self-Defense

1\. Defense of Legitimate Interests

**What can be defended?**

-   Life and bodily integrity

-   Property

-   Another person\'s interests (defense of others)

**Note:** Dutch law is **broader** than some systems - it explicitly
includes defense of property and others

2\. Imminent Attack

**Definition:** The attack must be happening NOW or about to happen
imminently

**THE TIMING RULE (Critical for Exams):**

-   ❌ **Too early** = Pre-emptive strike (NOT self-defense)

-   ✅ **Just right** = Imminent/ongoing attack (VALID self-defense)

-   ❌ **Too late** = Retaliation/revenge (NOT self-defense)

**Examples:**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Scenario**                        **Imminent?**   **Self-Defense?**
  ----------------------------------- --------------- ---------------------
  A raises a knife and is about to    YES             ✓ Valid
  stab you                                            

  A threatens \"I\'ll kill you        NO              ✗ Too early
  tomorrow\"                                          

  A punched you yesterday, today you  NO              ✗ Too late
  punch back                                          (retaliation)

  A is actively strangling you        YES             ✓ Valid

  You hear rumors A wants to hurt you NO              ✗ Too early (mere
                                                      fear)
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Phrase:** *Mere fear of an attack does NOT equal self-defense*

3\. Unlawful Attack

**The Rule:** You may NOT use self-defense against **lawful, justified
force**

**Unlawful Attack (Self-defense available):**

-   Criminal assaults you ✓

-   Someone tries to steal your property ✓

-   Police use **excessive** force during arrest ✓ (the excess is
    unlawful)

**Lawful Attack (No self-defense):**

-   Police lawfully arrest you using reasonable force ✗

-   Referee tackles you during a rugby match ✗ (you consented)

-   Prison guard restrains you appropriately ✗

**EXCEPTION: No self-defense against self-defense**

-   If someone is validly defending themselves, you can\'t claim
    self-defense against them

-   **Why?** Their defensive action is **justified** (lawful), and you
    can\'t defend against lawful force

4\. Necessity 1 (Necessary Defense)

**Question:** Did you HAVE to act in self-defense, or could you have
avoided the situation?

**The Retreat Rule (Jurisdiction-Dependent):**

-   **Some systems:** Duty to retreat if safely possible

-   **Other systems:** No duty to retreat (\"Stand Your Ground\")

5\. Proportionality

**The Rule:** The defensive force must be **proportionate** to the
threat

**How to Assess Proportionality:**

-   Compare the **interest threatened** vs. **interest harmed**

-   Compare the **severity of attack** vs. **severity of defense**

**Examples:**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Attack**              **Defense Response**    **Proportionate?**
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  Punch to the face       Punch back              ✓ YES

  Slap                    Shoot with gun          ✗ NO - excessive

  Deadly knife attack     Shoot to stop attacker  ✓ YES

  Teenager stealing apple Breaking their arm      ✗ NO - excessive

  Armed home invasion     Using weapon to defend  ✓ YES (likely)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Key Concept:** Life vs. Life is usually proportionate; Life vs.
Property usually is NOT

6\. Necessity 2 (Necessary Force)

**Question:** Was the specific amount of force you used necessary to
repel the attack?

**Distinction from Necessity 1:**

-   **Necessity 1:** Did you need to defend yourself at all?

-   **Necessity 2:** Given you needed to defend, did you use more force
    than necessary?

*This is where \"Self-Defense Excess\" comes in (see Section IV)*

7\. Prior Fault

**THE GOLDEN RULE: Prior fault defeats ALL defenses - both
justifications AND excuses**

**Definition:** If you caused the situation through your own wrongful
behavior, you cannot claim self-defense

**Examples:**

**Scenario 1: Provoked Fight**

-   You insult and push someone

-   They attack you back

-   You \"defend\" yourself and hurt them

-   **Result:** NO self-defense - you provoked the attack (prior fault)

**Scenario 2: Criminal Enterprise**

-   You\'re robbing a house

-   Homeowner attacks you

-   You \"defend\" yourself

-   **Result:** NO self-defense - you initiated the criminal situation

**Scenario 3: Mutual Combat**

-   You agree to a street fight

-   During the fight, the other person is winning

-   You now claim self-defense

-   **Result:** Likely NO self-defense - you consented to mutual combat

IV\. SELF-DEFENSE EXCESS (EXCUSE - STAGE 3)

What is Self-Defense Excess?

**Definition:** When you start with valid self-defense but use
**excessive force** beyond what\'s necessary

Key Characteristics

-   **Initial self-defense was justified** (Stages 1 & 2 fulfilled)

-   **But you went too far** in the amount of force
    (proportionality/necessity failed)

-   **This becomes an EXCUSE at Stage 3**, not a justification

Why It\'s an Excuse, Not a Justification

-   The **excessive part** of your act was **wrongful** (Stage 2:
    unlawful)

-   But we recognize you were in a **high-stress defensive situation**

-   So we **excuse** you from full blame (Stage 3: reduced culpability)

Types of Excess

**Intensive Excess:** Too much force

-   *Example:* Attacker slaps you, you shoot them

**Extensive Excess:** Continuing after threat ends

-   *Example:* Attacker falls down incapacitated, you keep beating them

Legal Outcome

-   **Not fully justified** (you did wrong)

-   **But partially or fully excused** (reduced or no blame)

-   Often results in: Reduced sentence or acquittal depending on
    circumstances

V. THE TRESPASSER SCENARIO (WORKING GROUP CASE)

Facts

-   A walks through the open door of B\'s home

-   A takes a seat on B\'s couch

-   A refuses to leave

-   **Question:** Can B forcefully remove A according to Article 41(1)
    Dutch Criminal Code?

Analysis Using Self-Defense Criteria

1\. Defense of Legitimate Interests?

✓ YES - Property rights (B\'s home) are included in Article 41(1)

2\. Imminent Attack?

✓ YES - The trespass is **ongoing** (A is currently on the property)

-   Not too early (A is already there)

-   Not too late (A hasn\'t left yet)

3\. Unlawful Attack?

✓ YES - Trespassing is unlawful

-   A has no right to be in B\'s home

-   Even if the door was open, entry without permission = trespass

4\. Necessity 1 (Necessary Defense)?

**QUESTION MARK** - Could B call the police instead?

-   If police response would be quick → maybe not necessary to use force

-   If police would take too long → force may be necessary

5\. Proportionality?

**DEPENDS on the force used:**

-   Gentle physical guidance out the door? → ✓ Likely proportionate

-   Punching A repeatedly? → ✗ Likely disproportionate

-   Property interest \< Bodily integrity interest

6\. Necessity 2 (Necessary Force)?

**DEPENDS** - Use minimum force needed to remove A:

-   Start with verbal commands

-   Then minimal physical force

-   No excessive violence

7\. Prior Fault?

**KEY ISSUE:** Did B leave the door open as an **invitation**?

-   If door open = implied invitation → A might argue no \"unlawful\"
    attack

-   If door merely unlocked but not inviting entry → Unlawful attack
    stands

Conclusion

**Most Likely Result:**

-   B can use **minimal force** to remove A

-   BUT must be proportionate and necessary

-   Excessive violence would NOT be justified

-   Calling police first might be required in Dutch law interpretation

**Differences by Jurisdiction:**

-   **German law:** Clearer right to defend property → B likely
    justified

-   **Dutch law:** More restrictive → May require exhausting
    alternatives first

VI\. EXAM STRATEGY FOR DEFENSE QUESTIONS

Step-by-Step Approach

**STEP 1: Complete Stage 1 Analysis First**

-   Establish all legal elements are fulfilled

-   Don\'t jump straight to defenses!

**STEP 2: Identify Potential Defenses**

-   Does the fact pattern suggest justification or excuse?

-   Which specific defense might apply?

**STEP 3: For Justifications (Stage 2)**

-   Go through ALL criteria systematically

-   Don\'t assume - test each one

-   If self-defense: Use all 7 criteria

**STEP 4: For Excuses (Stage 3)**

-   Only reach here if no justification found

-   Check if an excuse might apply

-   Consider prior fault

**STEP 5: Conclude Clearly**

-   State whether defense succeeds or fails

-   Explain the legal outcome

Common Exam Traps

❌ **TRAP 1:** Assuming self-defense automatically applies when someone
is attacked

-   **Solution:** Check ALL seven criteria

❌ **TRAP 2:** Confusing justification with excuse

-   **Solution:** Remember - justifications = act was right; excuses =
    not blameworthy

❌ **TRAP 3:** Forgetting prior fault

-   **Solution:** Always ask \"Did the defendant cause this situation?\"

❌ **TRAP 4:** Analyzing defenses when Stage 1 isn\'t fulfilled

-   **Solution:** Follow the framework - never skip stages

❌ **TRAP 5:** Ignoring proportionality

-   **Solution:** Always compare threat to response

VII\. FINAL SUMMARY

**Key Takeaways:**

-   **Justifications** (Stage 2) = \"What I did was RIGHT\"

-   **Excuses** (Stage 3) = \"What I did was WRONG, but don\'t blame
    me\"

-   **Self-defense** requires ALL 7 criteria to be met

-   **Prior fault** defeats ALL defenses

-   **Imminence** = not too early, not too late

-   **Proportionality** = force must match threat

-   **Self-defense excess** = started justified but went too far
    (excuse)

-   **Always** follow the tripartite framework systematically

**Remember: The tripartite framework is your roadmap!**

Master it, and defenses become much clearer.

Good luck with your studies! 📚⚖️
