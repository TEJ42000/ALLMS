Contract Law - Formation

A contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties.

Essential Elements:
1. Offer - A clear proposal made by one party to another
2. Acceptance - Unqualified agreement to the terms of the offer
3. Consideration - Something of value exchanged between parties
4. Intention to create legal relations
5. Capacity - Parties must have legal capacity to contract

Offer and Acceptance:
An offer must be communicated to the offeree and can be accepted
by conduct or express words. Acceptance must mirror the offer
(mirror image rule).

Consideration:
Consideration is the price paid for a promise. It must be sufficient
but need not be adequate. Past consideration is generally not valid.
