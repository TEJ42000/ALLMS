Roman Law and Legal History: Comprehensive Notes
Main Takeaway
Roman law established precise legal vocabulary and concepts (ownership, possession, detention) that fundamentally shaped Western legal systems. Emperor Justinian's sixth-century codification organized all Roman legal sources into four main categories: the Digest (jurist law), Institutes (textbook), Codex (imperial law), and Novels (post-Justinian legislation).
​
Historical Context of Roman Law
Importance and Development
•	Roman law emphasized in legal studies and legal history
•	While Germanic tribes (Phrygians) were hunting, Roman lawyers were already contemplating complex legal questions
•	Example: How does ownership transfer when a dignitary throws money into a crowd?
Evolution of Rome's Government
•	Kingdom of Rome → Republic (kings ousted, consuls led the state)
•	Empire (Julius Caesar era onwards, ruled by emperors)
•	Multiple legal sources created problems requiring codification
​
Key Legal Concepts
Ownership vs. Possession vs. Detention
| Concept | Definition | |---------|-----------| | Ownership | The right to a thing; best right to property | | Possession | Mere having of a thing without ownership rights | | Detention | Holding a thing with derived rights from the owner (e.g., library book checkout) |
Germanic Tribes vs. Roman Law
•	Germanic ancestors did not distinguish between ownership and detention
•	Did not have concept of testaments/wills
•	Testaments only became known when the Roman Catholic Church adopted Roman law as its basis
​
Justinian's Codification (Sixth Century)
Emperor Justinian
•	Lived: Sixth century
•	Region: Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium, Greek part)
•	Legacy: Greatest codifier of Roman law; responsible for organizing all legal sources
The Four Components of Justinian's Legislation
1. The Digest (Pandecta)
•	Contains Jus (law created by jurists)
•	Compiled in 50 books
•	Selected parts of law created by legal experts
•	Important: Justinian mentioned the original lawyer's name but declared it now spoke through his mouth
•	lex posterior rule does NOT apply (treated as single imperial constitution)
2. The Institutes (Elements)
•	First-year law student textbook
•	Justinian copied most content from existing textbook by Gaius
•	Unusual: A textbook elevated to official law status
3. The Codex Justinianus
•	Codifies imperial law (legislation created by emperors)
•	Arranged chronologically by issuing emperor
•	lex posterior rule APPLIES (later rules override earlier ones)
•	Justinian preserved original emperor names and authority
•	Contradictory rules resolved by applying the latest imperial expression of will
4. The Novels
•	Imperial legislation created after the Codex Justinianus
•	Issued by Justinian and subsequent emperors
•	Continued until approximately 1500 CE (fall of Byzantium)
​
Key Differences: Digest vs. Codex
Digest Characteristics
•	Single imperial constitution (Justinian's unified voice)
•	lex posterior rule does NOT apply
•	Contradictions resolved through legal reasoning:
•	Specific rules prevail over general rules
•	Identify main rule vs. exception
•	Emperor cannot contradict himself (legal fiction)
Codex Justinianus Characteristics
•	Arranged chronologically by emperor
•	lex posterior rule APPLIES
•	Later imperial legislation overrides earlier legislation
•	Original emperor attribution preserved

Problem-Solving in Roman Law
Resolving Contradictions in the Digest
Use your brain, use your ratio (reason) to solve these questions — Justinian
Method:
1.	When two contradicting rules exist in the Digest
2.	Apply the principle: specific prevails over general
3.	Designate one as main rule, other as exception
4.	This maintains the fiction that Justinian cannot contradict himself
​
Historical Context of Codification
Why Codification Was Necessary
•	Multiple legal sources created confusion and fraud opportunities
•	Dishonest lawyers would falsely attribute rules to famous jurists (e.g., Paulus) to win cases
•	Justinian sought to end fraud by officially determining which rules were valid law
Impact
•	Largest collection of laws ever converted into statutory law at one moment
•	Basis for Roman law knowledge and teaching for centuries
•	Later revival occurred when Greek texts were rediscovered
•	Sixth-century texts remained foundational for legal education
​
Case Study: Popov and Hayashi
•	Deals with multiple legal notions
•	Used to illustrate Roman law principles
•	References similarities between Dutch law and Roman law
•	Many definitions and terms remained nearly identical over centuries
​
Important Exam Concepts
•	Know which parts Justinian codified
•	Understand difference between Codex and Digest regarding lex posterior rule
•	Recognize that contradictions in Digest require legal reasoning, not chronological application
•	Identify sources: Digest (jurist law), Institutes (textbook), Codex (imperial law), Novels (post-Codex legislation)
