1.  The German philosopher Gustav Radbruch is the author of the famous
    \'Radbruch Formula,\' which outlines his vision of the nature of
    law. Explain which aspects of the formula can be traced back to the
    Epicurean school of thought and which to the Stoa.

2.  Provide one example of a code that is not a codification due to its
    lack of exclusivity, and one example of a textbook for students that
    is a codification or that is considered part of a codification.

3.  Suppose a plaintiff presents in court a judicial decision which
    provides evidence of the application of a rule of customary law. Is
    it possible for the opposing party to provide counter-evidence
    against the existence of that rule? If not, why not? If yes, why?

4.  The desire for legal certainty in Europe gave rise to the
    codification movement. Explain how England sought to achieve legal
    certainty, using the workbook case of Young vs. Bristol Aeroplane.

5.  The Italian lawyer Bartolus became famous for his daring
    interpretation of an imperial constitution that began with the words
    \'All peoples.\' Explain why such an extensive interpretation of
    these two words in general was necessary in his time.

6.  The French lawyer Charles Du Moulin had ambitious plans for the
    customary law of the city of Paris. Explain what he sought to
    accomplish with this plan and whether it would have found favor with
    the King of France.

7.  In the case of the Cantonal Court Schöneberg, you studied how a Nazi
    judge interpreted the statutory rules with regard of the eviction of
    a tenant, in a case regarding a Jewish tenant. Explain how he
    concluded that the criteria for eviction were met and which method
    of interpretation he misused to reach that conclusion.

8.  In the case of Bynkershoek (\'Observationes Tumultuariae\'), a
    merchant was awarded compensation by a court based on a rule of
    customary law, despite two statutory rules of local primary law
    explicitly forbidding the contract he concluded. Explain why,
    according to the Roman jurist Julian, these two statutory rules
    could be disregarded.

9.  The Court of Justice of the European Union has developed two
    exceptions in its case law regarding the duty of the highest courts
    of member states to refer questions of interpretation to the Court.
    One exception is known as \'acte clair\' (a case in which the text
    is considered to be clear). Evaluate whether this exception is
    sound, using the lessons learned from the case of \'the heart of De
    La Tour\' (De la Tour d\'Avergne v. De Pontavice).

10. Neither Roman law nor the laws of the Germanic tribes recognized the
    general rule that a simple agreement or informal arrangement between
    two people is binding. Where does the origin of the modern rule lie,
    which holds that mutual consent is sufficient to make an agreement
    binding?

11. Explain how the *ius praetorium* (the law of the praetor) can be
    compared to English equity jurisprudence.

12. The recorded customary law of a certain region on the continent of
    Europe, recorded at the beginning of the eighteenth century,
    contained the following provision regarding criminal law:

*\"All other offenses not included in this book shall be punished
according to the circumstances and the best rights.\"*

Why are such provisions considered unacceptable today?

13. When drafting a civil code, mistakes can occur. For example, in a
    former Civil Code, Article 1336, paragraph 3, the word \'creditor'
    was used, when \'debtor' should have been used in the official text.
    Why, however, was it not necessary to change the text?

14. Emperor Maximilian I established the Reichskammergericht (Imperial
    Chamber Court) on 7 August 1495. Which source of law it was intended
    to use to administer justice and explain why Maximilian chose this
    particular source.
