LEGAL HISTORY

**Complete Comprehensive Notes**

*English Law & European Integration*

PART 1: ENGLISH LEGAL SYSTEM

Judicature Acts (1873-75)

-   **Same courts for common law and equity:** High Court

-   **BUT:** Common law and equity remain separate sources of law

    -   Chancery Division

    -   King\'s Bench Division

-   **KEY POINT:** Both applied by same judges, still technically
    separate sources

-   **Example:** Specific performance (equity remedy) now available in
    all courts

The Fundamental Choice: Codification vs. Common Law

ENGLAND\'S PATH (18th-19th Century)

CAMP 1: Jeremy Bentham vs. CAMP 2: Blackstone

└─ PRO-CODIFICATION └─ ANTI-CODIFICATION

\'Create systematic code\' \'Common law = Gothic castle\'

⬇️

BLACKSTONE WINS

⬇️

NO CODIFICATION IN ENGLAND

MEMORY AID - \'BBC\': Bentham wanted codification, Blackstone opposed
it, Britain chose NO codification

Modern Court Hierarchy

SUPREME COURT (Est. 2009)

(Replaced House of Lords)

⬆️

Need permission to appeal

\|

COURT OF APPEAL

⬆️

Two appeals as of right

\|

HIGH COURT

⬆️

\|

LOCAL COURTS (First Instance)

MEMORY TECHNIQUE - \'SLHA\': Supreme (top), Local (bottom), High
(middle-upper), Appeal (middle-lower)

Historical Note: House of Lords (Pre-2009)

-   Members of House of Lords (legislative body) served as judges

-   Noble birth OR given life peerage to become judge

-   Did NOT vote on legislation (but symbolically part of Senate)

-   **PROBLEM:** Violated Montesquieu\'s separation of powers

-   **2009 REFORM:** Supreme Court created (still give judges life
    peerages as tradition)

PART 2: DOCTRINE OF PRECEDENT (STARE DECISIS)

Declaratory Theory of Judicial Decisions

-   **Judge doesn\'t create the law but finds it**

-   A string of decisions is evidence of common law

-   Chancery attacked for subjective decisions and lack of equity

-   Equity judges (17th century) started using precedent for consistency

The Core Concept

**DEFINITION:** Courts MUST follow prior decisions of higher courts and
their own prior decisions

DOCTRINE OF PRECEDENT

\|

┌────────────┴────────────┐

\| \|

BINDING PERSUASIVE

(Must follow) (May consider)

19th Century: Development of Stare Decisis

**Became a strict rule:** \'Maintain what has been decided and do not
alter that which has been established\'

-   Judges are obligated to obey precedents established by prior
    decisions

-   **1898:** House of Lords decided it was bound by its earlier
    decisions

-   Court of Appeal followed same rule shortly after

MEMORY AID - \'ESS\': Equity started it (17th C), Strict rules developed
(19th C), Softened slightly (1966)

Why England Has BINDING Precedent

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **CIVIL LAW SYSTEMS**               **COMMON LAW SYSTEMS**
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  Codification = Only Source          Judge Decisions = Source of Law

  Judges interpret code               Judges CREATE/FIND law

  **No binding precedent needed**     **NEED binding precedent**

  (Just practice to follow)           (For legal certainty)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Famous Quote: Oliver Wendell Holmes

> *\"The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience\"*

**MEANING:** Law develops through judicial decisions based on practical
experience, not just logical deduction from codes

Key Terms

**Ratio Decidendi:** The rationale for the decision - the legal
reasoning that is BINDING

-   The core legal principle that determined the outcome

-   Must be followed in future cases

**Obiter Dicta:** Statements said in passing, incidental statements -
NOT BINDING

-   Comments or observations not essential to decision

-   Persuasive only, not mandatory to follow

**The Beautiful Art of Distinguishing:** Finding differences between
current case and precedent to avoid being bound

Example: Ratio vs. Obiter

**Case:** Contract dispute about goods

-   **Ratio Decidendi (BINDING):** \"A contract requires offer,
    acceptance, and consideration\"

-   **Obiter Dicta (NOT BINDING):** \"Generally speaking, in
    negotiations, the offeror should act in good faith\"

> **→** This is just a comment, not essential to decision

Precedent \"On All Fours\"

A precedent applies if the prior case is **\"on all fours\"** with
current case:

-   Same legal issue

-   Same material facts

-   Ratio decidendi is clear

-   From higher or same level court

MEMORY AID - \'FOUR PAWS\': Facts similar, On point legally, Upperposed
court, Ratio clear + Prior decision, Applicable, Within hierarchy, Same
jurisdiction

The 1966 Practice Statement

**CRITICAL TURNING POINT:**

BEFORE 1966

House of Lords absolutely

bound by own decisions

⬇️

NO FLEXIBILITY

Even if led to injustice

⬇️

1966 PRACTICE STATEMENT

⬇️

May depart \'when it appears

right to do so\'

**KEY QUOTE:**

> *\"While treating former decisions as normally binding, we propose to
> depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so\"*

**Reasons for departure:**

1.  Previous decision leads to injustice

2.  Restricts proper development of law

3.  Society has changed significantly

**IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS:**

-   Only applies to Supreme Court (then House of Lords)

-   Does NOT affect other courts\' duty to follow precedent

-   Used sparingly - last resort measure

PART 3: INTERPRETATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF STATUTES

Two Approaches

4.  **English Approach:** Variety of legal sources in England

5.  **European Approach:** Continental/Civil Law approach

The Fundamental Difference

CIVIL LAW (Continental) COMMON LAW (English)

Code Statute

⬇️ ⬇️

FREE INTERPRETATION STRICT/LITERAL

(All methods available) (Grammatical focus)

⬇️ ⬇️

Judge fills gaps Limited interpretation

with legal principles If unclear → common law

Example: The \'He\' Problem

**SCENARIO:** Statute says: \"He who throws water shall be liable\"

**CIVIL LAW APPROACH:**

-   Statute says \'he\' → Use teleological interpretation

-   Obviously includes \'she\'

-   Apply broadly to all persons

**COMMON LAW APPROACH (Traditional):**

-   Statute says \'he\' → Interpret literally

-   Only applies to males?

-   **NEED INTERPRETATION ACT** (Legislation defines \'he\' includes
    \'she\')

Why the Difference?

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

England\'s Solution: The Interpretation Act

England created **legislation on how to interpret legislation!**

**INTERPRETATION ACT PROVIDES:**

-   \'He\' includes \'she\'

-   Singular includes plural

-   Other standardized interpretation rules

**WHY THIS EXISTS:**

-   English tradition = literal interpretation

-   Creates problems with gendered/number language

-   Parliament fixes it legislatively

-   Maintains grammatical approach while ensuring fairness

PART 4: EUROPE - POST-WAR EFFORTS

The European Problem: Constant Warfare

EUROPE\'S RECURRING PROBLEM

\|

CONSTANT WARFARE

\|

┌───────────────┼───────────────┐

\| \| \|

Napoleonic WWI WWII

(Early 1800s) (1914) (1939)

MEMORY AID - \'WWW\': Wars (Napoleonic), World War One, World War Two -
All France vs. Germany

Preventing War: Treaties or Transfer of Power?

**Early Proposals - The Dreamers:**

-   **Claude de Saint-Pierre:** \'Perpetual Peace in Europe\' - proposed
    European institutions taking sovereign power

-   **Congress of Vienna (1815):** End of Napoleon\'s reign → Status quo
    restored → FAILED

-   **League of Nations (Post-WWI):** Created by Treaty of Versailles →
    USA not member → FAILED

**THE PATTERN:**

6.  Major war ends

7.  Peace congress organized

8.  Status quo restored

9.  No institutional change

10. **War happens again**

Treaty of Versailles (1919)

-   **Lloyd George (UK PM) prediction:** \"This peace will hold 30 years
    maximum\"

-   **HE WAS RIGHT:** 1939 = WWII (exactly 20 years later)

-   League of Nations created but weak (USA not member)

After World War II: Two Problems

AFTER WORLD WAR II (1945)

\|

┌───────────┴───────────┐

\| \|

PROBLEM 1 PROBLEM 2

How prevent war? How protect democracy?

\| \|

Germany exists Iron Curtain divides

Could rearm Communist vs Democratic

Germany After WW2

**Marshall Plan (1947):** Economic recovery plan for Europe

**Germany divided into zones:**

-   Russian zone (East)

-   British zone (North)

-   American zone (South)

-   French zone (Southwest)

**New German State:**

-   West Germany (3 Western zones merged) - democratic

-   East Germany (Russian zone) - communist dictatorship

-   **French opposition** to German reunification (security concerns)

Cold War Context

**\"Iron Curtain\" (Churchill):**

-   Europe split into two halves

-   West: Democracies

-   East: Communist dictatorships under Soviet control

**1948: Czechoslovakia becomes communist**

-   Russians murdered democratic candidates

-   Showed threat of communist expansion

Winston Churchill\'s Role

-   Post-WWII: voted out as PM, became speaker

-   **Famous Speech: Zürich (1946) -** \"Let Europe Arise\"

-   Promoted European unity (though specifics unclear)

-   Influenced European Movement

-   **IRONY:** Boris Johnson (Brexit supporter) wrote Churchill
    biography but omitted European advocacy!

PART 5: EUROPEAN INSTITUTIONS

Council of Europe (1949)

**NOT THE EU!** (Different institution)

COUNCIL OF EUROPE

PARLIAMENT COURT (ECHR)

(Not very successful) (Very successful)

**PURPOSE:**

-   Promote human rights

-   Strengthen democracy

-   Counter communist threat

European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)

**Created by Council of Europe**

To promote democracy and keep communism at bay

**Treaty Purpose - Rights against government:**

11. Right to family life

12. Ban on torture

13. Ban on slavery

14. Right to a fair trial

**KEY ACHIEVEMENT:**

EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS

⬇️

Binding treaty for member states

⬇️

European Court of Human Rights

⬇️

Judges review violations

Size Comparison

**COUNCIL OF EUROPE:** 47 members (including Russia - suspended 2022)

**EUROPEAN UNION:** 27 members (smaller, more integrated)

Meloni\'s Critique (2024)

**Open letter from Italian PM + 28 other leaders:**

> *\"Has the European Court of Human Rights extended the scope of the
> Convention too far compared with the original intentions?\"*

**THE ARGUMENT:**

Original Intent: Modern Reality:

Keep communism out vs. Broad human rights

Protect democracy Limits migration

Anti-totalitarian Detailed family law

**THIS IS A COURSE THEME!**

-   Justinian: \"Refer unclear cases back to me\" (authentic
    interpretation)

-   Enlightenment: Judges should apply law mechanically

-   Modern: Judges interpret freely

-   **Meloni wants:** Bind judges to original legislative intent

PART 6: THE COAL AND STEEL SOLUTION

The Genius Idea: Jean Monnet Plan

THE PROBLEM:

How prevent Germany from rearming?

⬇️

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS FAILED:

Versailles → WWII happened anyway

⬇️

NEW APPROACH (1950):

CREATE SUPRANATIONAL INSTITUTION

⬇️

European Coal and Steel Community (1951)

How It Works

MEMBER STATES

(France, Germany, Italy, Benelux)

⬇️

Give control of COAL & STEEL to

⬇️

SUPRANATIONAL BODY

(Independent institution)

⬇️

Institution controls production

⬇️

CANNOT BUILD WEAPONS

**THE BRILLIANCE:**

Coal + Steel = War materials

⬇️

Control coal/steel = Control war capacity

⬇️

Supranational control = No unilateral war

⬇️

70+ YEARS OF PEACE IN WESTERN EUROPE

Why This Succeeded

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **METHOD**              **RESULT**              **OUTCOME**
  ----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
  Congress of Vienna      Status quo              War in 55 years

  Treaty of Versailles    Harsh terms             War in 20 years

  **ECSC**                **Structural            **70+ years peace**
                          prevention**            
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**KEY DIFFERENCE:**

-   Not just promises or treaties

-   **Institutional control** over means of war

-   Cannot secretly rearm

-   Sovereignty partially transferred

From ECSC to EU

1951: Coal & Steel Community

⬇️

1957: Economic Community added

⬇️

Later: EURATOM added

⬇️

Gradual expansion

⬇️

MODERN EU (27 members)

**PROFESSOR\'S MAIN POINT:**

> *\"From historical perspective, preventing war is MORE IMPORTANT than
> free movement, single currency, or other EU benefits. Economic
> integration is nice, but 70 years without war is the real success.\"*

West Germany\'s Integration

1945: Germany occupied (4 zones)

⬇️

1949: West Germany created

⬇️

Still under Allied High Commission

⬇️

Konrad Adenauer = Chancellor

(Anti-Nazi, former Cologne mayor)

⬇️

1951: Joins Coal & Steel Community

⬇️

GAINS RECOGNITION AS STATE

**WHY BONN CHOSEN AS CAPITAL:**

-   Berlin = isolated island in communist East Germany

-   Bonn = safe in Western zone

-   Symbolic: temporary until reunification
