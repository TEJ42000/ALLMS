From Republic to Empire
-----------------------

• The Romans held traditional public celebrations and valued the republic, seen in Julius Caesar's refusal of a crown offered by Marcus Antonius—"No kings in Rome"—to avoid monarchy.
• After the conquest of Gaul and Caesar's rise in power, republican leaders feared the destruction of the Republic and the creation of a monarchy.
• Caesar was assassinated by senators (notably Brutus) at a Senate meeting in 44 BCE, triggering a transition.



Centralization of Power
-----------------------

• Caesar's death led to civil war between republicans and those supporting Caesar's popular policies (e.g., land for soldiers, wealth for people).
• Caesar's adopted son, Gaius Octavianus (later Augustus), after prevailing in civil war, became the first Roman emperor.
• Augustus maintained republican institutions (elections for consuls, etc.) for appearance but held lifelong centralized powers, including proconsul for life and the tribunicia potestas (tribunician veto power).
• The public assembly's legislative function declined as the Empire grew; legislative power shifted to the emperor, with the Senate giving only formal approval.
• The title 'Caesar' became hereditary among rulers, evolving into terms like Kaiser and Tsar in later Europe.



Sources of Law: Emperor and Jurists
-----------------------------------

• Two main sources of law developed: (a) constitutions and edicts from the emperor (imperial legislation) and (b) edicts and interpretations by judicial magistrates (praetors) and jurists (legal scholars).
• Praetors historically shaped private law through annual edicts; Emperor Hadrian commissioned Salvius Julianus to finalize the Praetorial Edict, ending annual revisions and promoting scholarly commentary.
• Jurists' writings became increasingly influential and eventually a recognized source of law, especially through authorized jurists (the 'big five': Gaius, Ulpianus, Paulus, Papinianus, Modestinus).



Codification of Roman Law
-------------------------

• With the empire's east-west division, each half had an emperor, but legislation remained complex and uncoordinated.
• Private collections of laws (by Hermogenianus, Gregorianus) preceded official compilations; Theodosius II commissioned the Codex Theodosianus (5th c.), organizing valid imperial laws chronologically but not completely excluding previous laws.
• Jurist law was systematized through rules on citation ('lex citandi'), restricting legal authority to the 'big five' jurists, with majority opinions and Papinian’s opinions given special precedence.



Justinian’s Legal Reforms
-------------------------

• Emperor Justinian (6th c., eastern empire in Constantinople) aimed to consolidate Roman legal heritage and strengthen imperial authority.
• He hired jurist Tribonian and committees to produce comprehensive codifications:
• **Codex Justinianus** (529): Exclusive, authoritative collection of all imperial legislation, structured in 12 books, superseding previous codes.
• **Digest (Pandects)** (533): A massive 50-book compilation of juristic writings on private law, cut-and-paste from leading jurists, now serving as sole source of jurist law.
• **Institutiones**: An official student textbook, published as legislation, to guide legal education.
• All contradictions within the Digest had to be resolved by judicial interpretation or could be authoritatively answered by the emperor.



Legacy and Influence of Roman Law
---------------------------------

• Justinian’s codification became the foundation of Roman law, preserving both imperial constitutions and jurist thought as a unified legal structure.
• The Codex Justinianus and Digest influenced later European legal codes (French, German, Dutch, Italian, etc.), affecting legal concepts and structuring modern civil law systems.
