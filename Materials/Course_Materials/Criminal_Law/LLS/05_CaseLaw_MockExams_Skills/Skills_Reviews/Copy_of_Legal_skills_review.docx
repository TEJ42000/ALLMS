## Finding and analyzing legislation; ECHR (W1)

There is no difference in legal status between Act & Code;

Code = legal rules for a particular area of law, Act = for separate
'topics'

Main units: articles / statutory provisions (UK: sections)

paragraphs (UK: subsections)

> subparagraphs

Referring: e.g. art. 36(3)(b)

### Finding relevant articles

1)  determine the area of law (private / public; administrative /
    > criminal / constitutional etc.)

2)  in which act / code to find the answer?

3)  scan articles for appropriate section

#### Dutch Civil Code

-   each book - specific area of private law; books 1-6 & most of books
    > 7 & 8 have legal force

-   books 3, 5, 6, 7, 7A and 8 go from general to specific

#### Dutch Penal Code

> Book 1: general provisions - regulates general issues
>
> Book 2: serious offenses and corresponding maximum sentences
>
> Book 3: summary offenses - categorized the same as book 2

-   one article can contain multiple offenses

-   majority of provisions of book 1 apply to special statutes (e.g.
    > Opium Act Decree) as well

#### General Administrative Law Act (GALA)

-   pyramidal structure, identical to the Dutch Civil Code

-   specific to general

### Analyzing articles (provisions)

-   provisions: legal conditions and legal consequences:

-   legal conditions: prerequisites that have to be fulfilled for the
    > legal consequences to take effect;

    -   **alternative** conditions (either / or)

    -   **cumulative** conditions (and)

-   sometimes Dutch law allows the court to impose both an imprisonment
    > and a fine although formulated as alternative conditions (art. 9)

### European Convention on Human Rights

-   adopted in 1953 by the Council of Europe; official languages English
    > and French

-   only absolute right: prohibition of torture

-   purpose of CoE: to protect human rights in Europe

-   purpose of ECHR: to make sure every of the 46 member states is
    > implementing and enforcing the convention in the right way

#### **Violation of human rights**

National courts;

1.  lower court (1st instance)

2.  high court (court of appeal - 2nd instance)

3.  supreme court (3rd instance)

4.  constitutional court if exists (4th instance)

after exhaustion of domestic rights → **ECtHR**;

-   claim against your member state (individual v state / state v state)

-   **admissibility**:

    -   exhaustion of domestic remedies

    -   within 4 months

    -   concerns convention right(s)

    -   personally and directly victim

    -   significant disadvantage

    -   against member state

-   composition: single-judge / 3 judges / 7 judges / 17 judges

-   every judge allowed their own opinion (and voicing it);

    -   **concurring**: agree but not with reasoning

    -   **dissenting**: disagreeing with everything

## *Interpretations and reasoning* (W2)

### Methods of interpretation

1)  **Grammatical**: legal meaning of words (reference → dictionary)

2)  **Using legislative history**: according to what the legislator had
    > in mind, as interpreted from the parliamentary and political
    > history of a statute

3)  **Systematic**: fits in with the system of law, ties in with the
    > situations regulated by law

4)  **Historical**: legal system from which the provision originates

5)  Anticipatory: fits the meaning in a new, established law that is
    > about to enter into force but hasn't yet (to avoid appeals)

6)  **Teleological**: according to the aim / purpose of the law

7)  **Comparative**: ties in with the meaning of a relevant provision in
    > a foreign legal system

8)  **In conformity with treaty law**: deviant from the will of the
    > legislator, according to treaty law binding on all persons

### Legal reasoning

Casus omissus: when a legislator fails to provide a rule for a certain
case → resorts to legal reasonings:

1)  **Analogy**

-   a legal rule is applied in a situation not directly covered by the
    > law

-   legislator wishes that similar situations be treated similarly

-   in Dutch criminal law, reasoning by analogy is prohibited, but
    > extensive interpretation is allowed

2)  **A contrario**

-   legislator provides rules for a specific situation for a particular
    > reason, so they cannot be applicable in different situations
    > (regulated situation is too special)

-   used when the legislator has failed to provide for an exception to a
    > rule (too general)

-   methods of interpretation can be combined with legal reasoning

3)  **The effect of the interpretation**

-   extensive and restrictive;

    -   **extensive**: provision given a broader explanation

    -   **restrictive**: provision given a narrower meaning

-   courts may use earlier decisions (precedents) or views of
    > influential authors

### Methods of interpretation by ECtHR

#### Effective protection

1)  national protection must go beyond mere lip-service

2)  look behind appearances: take position of the individual, analyze
    > potential restrictions from his/her perspective

3)  BUT convention is a system of collective enforcement of multiple
    > countries

4)  convention is a living instrument / method of **dynamic
    > interpretation**:

#### Dynamic interpretation

1)  in light of present-day context

2)  new societal challenges → new approach

3)  looks to Member States: Why look for consensus? Has to be in
    > accordance with national law; there is no international executive
    > branch, it works according to national services. The stronger the
    > consensus, the stronger the Court's support

#### Principle of subsidiarity

-   [ECtHR does not take action (except in the areas that fall within
    > its exclusive jurisdiction), unless it is more effective than
    > action taken at the national, regional or local level]{.mark}

-   [ECtHR leaves the states a '**margin of appreciation** /
    > discretion':]{.mark}

    -   [gives the flexibility needed to avoid damaging confrontations
        > between the Court and the Member States]{.mark}

    -   [more consensus → narrower margin; margin especially wide in
        > 'sensitive' areas (morality / ethics / social policy)]{.mark}

## Legal research (W3)

Legal research:

-   describing

-   understanding

-   explaining

-   evaluating the law

... in a systematic way

### Doctrinal legal research

-   analyzes applicable law and describes it 'as is' not 'as it should
    > be (**legal positivism**)

-   characteristics:

    -   neutral, consistent, clear description of the law

    -   new developments in the system of law (e.g. AI)

    -   building a system, advancing coherence, confronting
        > (inter)national law

    -   **internal perspective** → legal lens to analyze the law (e.g.
        > legal concepts)

    -   methods: textual analysis, argumentation analysis, logic

-   drawbacks:

    -   no clear methods, no clear theory → no science

    -   researchers are not explicit on how they evaluate the law

    -   description cannot be neutral → law protects vested interests

### Meta-legal research

-   analyzes applicable law 'as it ought to be' instead of 'as is'
    > (**normative approach**)

-   characteristics:

    -   **external perspective** → non-legal lens to analyze the law

    -   social scientific facts, economics, history, philosophy etc.

-   drawbacks:

    -   no connection to legal practice → too theoretical

    -   faulty methods / methodology → sloppy research

    -   too normative to qualify as science

## Types of research questions (W4)

1.  **descriptive / defining**: addresses how something is expressed,
    > how it functions or how a phenomenon can be defined in legal terms

2.  **comparative**: addresses the differences and resembles between
    > certain concepts / how something is expressed at different moments
    > in time

3.  **evaluating**: addresses the assessment and evaluation of something

4.  **explanatory**: focuses on why something is as is or on how it came
    > about; looks at causes, relationships and underlying motives or
    > reasons

5.  **design**: focuses on the making of something whereby you can
    > achieve a desired situation

6.  **predictive**: addresses how something will be in the future

## Tips and tricks for the exam (W6)

a.  Start reading the case with 'THE LAW' or the dissenting / concurring
    > opinion, after it:

    i.  Identify decision of the Court

    ii. Scan the facts

    iii. Read the Court's assessment in-depth

b.  Identify the structure of the case - where can you find the headings
    > pinpointing to the criteria, which one is the longest / focused on
    > the most?

c.  Highlight the names of the parties - case will be also in paper, so
    > bring highlighters

d.  Focus on the Court's Assessment

e.  Refer to the right paragraphs

f.  Paraphrase - do not copy-paste!

# **Case questions**

## Relevant facts (Q1)

## 

Criteria for determining relevant facts: do they change something within
the case?

Usually end before legal proceedings, but often overlap with them.

*Legal proceedings (Q2)*

## 

Criteria for determining the start of the legal proceedings: what
started the legal conflict, and therefore the legal proceedings? -
action / omission of the State / local authorities etc. that interfered
with the applicant's right.

In the end, always refer back to the first paragraphs which state that
the applicant lodged a complaint with the ECtHR.

## *Main question of law* (*Q3)*

Main question: Does the **act** by the person / organization constitute
a **violation** of the applicant's **ECHR right**, as laid down in
**source**? (para.)\*

1)  Does the **act** by the person / organization constitute an
    > **interference** of the applicant's **ECHR right**, as laid down
    > in **source (1)**? (para.)\*\*

2)  If so, can this **interference** be **justified** under the **source
    > (2)**? (para.)\*\*\*

Always refer to paragraphs where the questions were asked; preferably
those paragraphs where they were mentioned for the first time.

\*mention the 1st paragraph after 'alleged violation of article' and the
last one with the decision

\*\*mention the specific paragraphs in the 'Merits' \> 'Whether there
was an interference' part

\*\*\*mention the 1st paragraph where the justifications start and add
'et seq.'

## *Justifications (Q4)*

1.  **In accordance with the law**

    a.  basis in domestic law

    b.  accessible

    c.  foreseeable

2.  **In a legitimate aim** (never learn by heart, stated in pt 2 'in
    > the interest')

    a.  national security

    b.  public safety

    c.  economic well-being of the country

    d.  prevention of disorder or crime

    e.  protection of health or morals

    f.  protection of the rights and freedoms of others

3.  **Necessary in a democratic society**

    a.  pressing social need

    b.  proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued

    c.  the reasons adduced by the national authorities should be
        > relevant and sufficient

Always mention paragraphs in answers!

Do not always copy-paste the criteria for interference, as the Court
does not always mention all these bullet points; look into the case for
the specific criteria mentioned!
