## 🔑 KEY CONCEPTS & FRAMEWORKS

### PART A: The Tripartite Framework

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPT IN PART A**

```
STAGE 1: LEGAL ELEMENTS
│
├─→ ACTUS REUS (Objective Elements)
│   ├─ Conduct (act or omission)
│   ├─ Result (consequence)
│   └─ Causation (link between conduct & result)
│
├─→ MENS REA (Subjective Elements)
│   ├─ Intent (direct, indirect, dolus eventualis)
│   └─ Negligence (conscious, unconscious)
│
│   ❌ If ANY element missing → NO LIABILITY (STOP HERE)
│   ✅ If ALL elements fulfilled → Proceed to Stage 2
│
▼
STAGE 2: UNLAWFULNESS
│
├─→ JUSTIFICATIONS (lawful conduct)
│   ├─ Self-defense (7 criteria)
│   ├─ Necessity
│   └─ State order / legal duty
│
│   ✅ If justified → NO LIABILITY (STOP HERE)
│   ❌ If NO justification → Proceed to Stage 3
│
▼
STAGE 3: CULPABILITY / BLAMEWORTHINESS
│
├─→ EXCUSES (wrongful but not blameworthy)
│   ├─ Duress
│   ├─ Insanity defense
│   ├─ Self-defense excess
│   ├─ Provocation
│   ├─ Mistake of law (reasonable)
│   └─ Intoxication
│
│   ✅ If excused → NO LIABILITY (STOP HERE)
│   ❌ If NO excuse → CRIMINAL LIABILITY
│
▼
CRIMINAL LIABILITY ESTABLISHED
```

### Critical Rules for Tripartite Framework

1. **SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS**: Always proceed in order (1 → 2 → 3)
2. **STOP WHEN STAGE FAILS**: If Stage 1 not fulfilled, don't analyze Stages 2 or 3
3. **JUSTIFICATIONS ≠ EXCUSES**: 
   - Justification = "It wasn't wrong" (Stage 2)
   - Excuse = "It was wrong, but don't blame me" (Stage 3)
4. **NEVER SKIP STAGES**: Even if you know the answer, show your work

### Self-Defense (Seven Criteria)

Must satisfy ALL seven for justified self-defense:

1. **Defense of legitimate interests** (life, bodily integrity, property, others)
2. **Attack must be imminent** (about to happen or happening now)
3. **Attack must be unlawful** (not justified itself)
4. **Defense must be necessary** (no other reasonable alternative)
5. **Defense must be proportionate** (reasonable force)
6. **Subjective element** (belief attack is happening)
7. **No prior fault** (didn't provoke or create the situation)

### Causation Analysis

**Two-Step Test:**

#### 1. Factual Causation (Conditio Sine Qua Non / "But For" Test)
"But for the defendant's act, would the result have occurred when and as it did?"

- If NO → Causation established, proceed to Step 2
- If YES → No factual causation, NO LIABILITY

#### 2. Legal Causation (Attribution)
Even if factually caused, can result be legally attributed?

**Intervening Causes:**
- **Foreseeable natural event** → Usually causation maintained
- **Culpable perpetrator** → Intent makes consequences "never too remote"
- **Highly culpable third party** → Usually breaks chain
- **Unforeseeable victim conduct** → Usually breaks chain
- **Victim predispositions** → Usually doesn't break chain ("thin skull rule")

---

### PART B: Key ECHR Frameworks

### Engel Criteria (What is "Criminal"?)

From **Öztürk v. Germany** - Three criteria to determine if proceeding is "criminal":

1. **Domestic classification** (what does national law call it?)
2. **Nature of the offense** (what interests does it protect?)
3. **Severity of potential penalty** (how serious is punishment?)

**Test is alternative, not cumulative** - satisfying any one criterion may suffice.

### Article 6 ECHR: Fair Trial Rights

**Article 6(1)**: Right to fair hearing by independent, impartial tribunal  
**Article 6(2)**: Presumption of innocence  
**Article 6(3)**: Minimum rights of defense

#### Key Article 6 Principles:

1. **Applies to pre-trial proceedings** (Salduz)
2. **Overall fairness assessment** (look at proceedings as a whole)
3. **Privilege against self-incrimination** (can't be forced to incriminate yourself)
4. **Right to remain silent** (no adverse inference from silence)
5. **Right to lawyer from first interrogation** (Salduz)
6. **Evidence obtained by torture = always inadmissible** (Jalloh, Gäfgen)

### Salduz v. Turkey Principles

**Right to Lawyer in Pre-Trial Stage:**

- Access to lawyer required **from first police interrogation**
- Absence may render proceedings unfair **as a whole**
- Early access = safeguard against:
  - Self-incrimination
  - Ill-treatment
  - Unequal arms with prosecution

**When can statements without lawyer be used?**
- Generally: NO (unless compelling reasons exist)
- Must assess: overall fairness of proceedings
- Consider: was defendant able to challenge evidence later?

### Al-Khawaja / Schatschaschwili Test (Absent Witnesses)

**Three-Step Interrelated Test for Article 6(3)(d):**

#### Step 1: Good Reason for Non-Attendance?
- Witness unavailable for valid reason?
- Examples: death, fear, untraceable
- State must make reasonable efforts to secure attendance

#### Step 2: Was Statement Sole or Decisive?
- "Sole or decisive" = conviction impossible without it
- **Not rigid exclusionary rule** (post-Al-Khawaja)
- Rather: factor in overall fairness assessment
- Greater decisiveness → stronger counterbalancing needed

#### Step 3: Counterbalancing Factors Sufficient?
- Was defendant able to challenge statement's reliability?
- Opportunity at pre-trial stage may suffice
- Consider: procedural safeguards, corroboration, judicial scrutiny
- **Balance**: defense rights vs. witness protection vs. public interest

**Critical**: Steps are **interrelated**, not independent - must assess holistically for overall fairness.

### Article 3 ECHR: Prohibition of Torture

**Absolute right** - no exceptions, no derogation, even in emergencies.

**Minimum Level of Severity Required:**
Consider:
1. Duration of treatment
2. Physical/mental effects
3. Purpose and intention
4. Position of victim (vulnerability)
5. Context of the situation

**Three Categories:**
1. **Torture** (most severe - special stigma)
2. **Inhuman treatment** (causes intense suffering)
3. **Degrading treatment** (humiliation, debasement)

**Evidence Obtained by Violation:**
- **Torture** → Evidence ALWAYS inadmissible (automatic Art. 6 violation)
- **Inhuman/degrading** → Usually inadmissible if decisive for conviction

---

## 📖 IMPORTANT CASE LAW SUMMARY

### Part A Cases (Implicit in Materials)

While Part A focuses on legal frameworks rather than specific cases, key principles derive from:
- Dutch Supreme Court decisions on self-defense
- German Constitutional Court on legality principle
- Comparative analysis of common law vs. civil law systems

### Part B Cases (Must Memorize for Exam)

#### Week 1-2: Defining "Criminal" & Investigations

**Öztürk v. Germany** (1984)
- **Issue**: Are administrative traffic fines "criminal"?
- **Holding**: Yes, under Engel criteria
- **Significance**: Established three-part test for "criminal charge"
- **Memorize**: Engel criteria (classification, nature, severity)

**Venditelli v. Italy** (1994)
- **Context**: Related to scope of ECHR application

#### Week 3: Investigation Rights & Self-Incrimination

**Salduz v. Turkey** (2008) 🌟 **CRITICAL**
- **Facts**: Suspect denied lawyer during interrogation; confessed
- **Issue**: Does Art. 6 require lawyer access from first interrogation?
- **Holding**: YES - right to lawyer attaches from first interrogation
- **Significance**: Fundamental safeguard against self-incrimination
- **Memorize**: 
  - Pre-trial stage determines framework for trial
  - Suspects particularly vulnerable without legal assistance
  - Statements without lawyer access generally inadmissible

**Jalloh v. Germany** (2006) 🌟 **CRITICAL**
- **Facts**: Police forcibly administered emetics to retrieve swallowed drugs
- **Issues**: Art. 3 (degrading treatment) + Art. 6 (fair trial)
- **Holdings**: 
  - VIOLATED Art. 3 (inhuman & degrading treatment)
  - VIOLATED Art. 6 (evidence inadmissible)
- **Significance**: Real evidence obtained by Art. 3 violation renders trial unfair
- **Memorize**: 
  - Forced bodily intrusion = degrading treatment
  - Evidence from Art. 3 violation = unfair trial
  - Privilege against self-incrimination includes real evidence

**Gäfgen v. Germany** (2010) 🌟 **CRITICAL**
- **Facts**: Police threatened kidnapper with pain to locate victim
- **Issues**: Art. 3 (threat of torture) + Art. 6 (fair trial)
- **Holdings**:
  - VIOLATED Art. 3 (threat of torture)
  - NO VIOLATION Art. 6 (evidence excluded; conviction based on later confession)
- **Significance**: Distinguishes real evidence from confession; examines proceedings as whole
- **Memorize**:
  - Threat of serious pain = torture/inhuman treatment
  - Evidence from torture always inadmissible
  - BUT: conviction based on untainted confession = fair trial overall

#### Week 5: Trial Rights & Absent Witnesses

**Colozza v. Italy** (1985)
- **Issue**: Trial in absentia without notice
- **Holding**: Violated Art. 6 - defendant must have opportunity to participate
- **Significance**: Establishes limits on in absentia trials

**De Cubber v. Belgium** (1984)
- **Issue**: Judge who investigated case also presided at trial
- **Holding**: Violated Art. 6(1) - tribunal not impartial
- **Significance**: Establishes objective + subjective tests for impartiality
- **Memorize**:
  - **Subjective test**: Personal bias of judge?
  - **Objective test**: Would reasonable observer have doubts?

**Lala v. Netherlands** (1994)
- **Context**: Confrontation rights and use of pre-trial statements

#### Week 6: Witness Testimony

**Schatschaschwili v. Germany** (2015) 🌟 **CRITICAL**
- **Facts**: Conviction based on absent witness statements never confronted
- **Issue**: When can absent witness statements be used under Art. 6(3)(d)?
- **Holding**: Refined Al-Khawaja test - three-step interrelated assessment
- **Significance**: Most current framework for confrontation rights
- **Memorize**: 
  - **Step 1**: Good reason for non-attendance?
  - **Step 2**: Was statement sole or decisive? (Not rigid rule)
  - **Step 3**: Sufficient counterbalancing factors?
  - **Critical**: Steps are interrelated; assess overall fairness
  - Opportunity to challenge at pre-trial stage may suffice

## ✍️ IRAC METHODOLOGY

### What is IRAC?

**IRAC** = **I**ssue, **R**ule, **A**pplication/Analysis, **C**onclusion

This is THE structure for answering exam questions in both Part A and Part B.

### The Four Components

#### **I - ISSUE**
State the legal question you're addressing.

**Format**: "The issue is whether [defendant] is criminally liable for [offense]."

**Part A Example**:  
"The issue is whether A is criminally liable for murder under Article [X] of the Criminal Code."

**Part B Example**:  
"The issue is whether the use of the coerced confession violated B's right to a fair trial under Article 6 ECHR."

#### **R - RULE**
State the applicable legal rule/test/framework.

**Part A**: Usually the tripartite framework + specific offense elements

**Example**:
"Under the tripartite framework, criminal liability requires: (1) fulfillment of all legal elements (actus reus + mens rea), (2) no justifications, and (3) no excuses. Murder requires: (a) killing of another human being, (b) intent to kill, and (c) no applicable defenses."

**Part B**: ECHR article + ECtHR case law test

**Example**:
"Article 6(1) ECHR guarantees the right to a fair trial, which includes the privilege against self-incrimination (Jalloh v. Germany). Evidence obtained through inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 renders a trial unfair if it was decisive for conviction."

#### **A - APPLICATION / ANALYSIS**
Apply the rule to the facts. This is the longest section - show your reasoning!

**Structure**:
1. State relevant facts
2. Apply each element of the rule systematically
3. Consider counterarguments
4. Explain why rule applies (or doesn't apply) to these facts

**Part A Example**:
"**Stage 1 - Legal Elements**: A shot B in the chest, causing B's death (actus reus fulfilled). A intended to kill B, as evidenced by [facts] (mens rea fulfilled). All legal elements are present.

**Stage 2 - Unlawfulness**: A claims self-defense. For self-defense to apply: [list 7 criteria]. Here, while B was attacking A (imminent unlawful attack), A used excessive force by shooting B when less harmful alternatives were available (fails proportionality requirement). Therefore, self-defense does not justify A's conduct.

**Stage 3 - Culpability**: A claims provocation as an excuse..."

**Part B Example**:
"Under the first step of the Schatschaschwili test, there was a good reason for W's non-attendance (W had died before trial). Under step 2, W's statement was decisive - the conviction was impossible without it, as it was the only evidence placing D at the scene. Under step 3, there were insufficient counterbalancing factors. D had no opportunity to challenge W's statement at pre-trial stage (W died before D could confront). The trial court admitted the statement without corroboration or procedural safeguards. While steps are interrelated, the lack of any confrontation opportunity combined with decisiveness renders proceedings unfair overall."

#### **C - CONCLUSION**
State your conclusion clearly and concisely.

**Format**: "Therefore, [defendant] is/is not criminally liable for [offense]."

**Part A Example**:  
"Therefore, A is criminally liable for murder, as all three stages of the tripartite framework are satisfied."

**Part B Example**:  
"Therefore, the use of W's statement violated Article 6(3)(d) in conjunction with Article 6(1) ECHR, rendering the trial as a whole unfair."

---

### IRAC Tips for Success

1. **Be Explicit**: Don't assume the examiner knows what you're thinking - spell it out

2. **Use Headings**: Clearly label Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion

3. **Cite Authority**: 
   - Part A: Cite articles, framework stages
   - Part B: Cite cases by name (e.g., "As established in Salduz v. Turkey...")

4. **Show Your Work**: Even if conclusion seems obvious, demonstrate your reasoning step-by-step

5. **Address Counterarguments**: Acknowledge opposing views and explain why you reject them

6. **Stay Organized**: 
   - Part A: Follow tripartite stages sequentially
   - Part B: Follow multi-step tests (Engel, Schatschaschwili) systematically

7. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: Use working group questions to master the format
