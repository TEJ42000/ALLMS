## **What is Criminal Procedure Law?**

### **Distinction Between Substantive and Procedural Criminal Law:**

**Substantive Criminal Law (Part A):**

- What behaviors are criminal?
- Under what conditions?
- What is prohibited in society? (murder, manslaughter, etc.)
- Theories of punishment
- Excuses and defenses

**Procedural Criminal Law (Part B):**

- HOW criminal cases are conducted through the justice system
- The process from investigation to verdict
- Rights of defendants during proceedings
- Fair trial guarantees

-----

## **Course Focus: European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)**

### **Why Focus on ECHR?**

- **75 years old** (established 1950)
- **Largest regional human rights system** in the world
- **Extensive case law** with significant impact
- **Applicable** to all European justice systems

### **Key Principle:**

Criminal procedure law is **highly national** - every country has its own culture, history, and traditions reflected in their criminal justice system.

**Course Approach:**

- Study **fundamental principles** common to democratic criminal justice systems
- Focus on **universal stages** of criminal proceedings (police → prosecution → judiciary)
- Use ECHR as framework to understand human rights in criminal procedure

### **Important Distinction:**

- This course does **NOT** cover International Criminal Court (ICC)
- ICC deals with: war crimes, genocide, crimes against humanity
- If interested in ICC → study Global Criminal Law Master program

-----

## **The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR)**

### **Location:** Strasbourg, France

### **Function:**

- Individuals can file complaints against their **national state**
- Court determines if state violated ECHR rights
- **Role reversal:** In national proceedings, defendant faces state; at ECtHR, individual complains against state

### **Key Concept - Article 6 ECHR (Right to Fair Trial):**

The Court assesses proceedings **“as a whole”** - not just isolated moments

**Important Terms:**

- **Compensating measures** - other procedural safeguards that balance out deficiencies
- **Counterbalancing factors** - elements that restore fairness to proceedings

**Core Balance:**
Criminal procedure = **State power** vs. **Individual rights**

- State power is necessary for safe society
- BUT it cannot be arbitrary
- Must respect defendant’s rights

-----

## **Lifespan of a Criminal Case:**

1. **Investigation** (police, supervised by prosecution)
1. **Prosecution Decision** (to prosecute or not)
1. **Trial Preparation**
1. **Trial** (court examines the case)
1. **Verdict** (conviction/acquittal)
1. **Sanction** (if convicted)
1. **Execution** (carrying out the sentence)

*(Note: Appeal procedures exist but not covered in this course)*

## **HOW TO READ ECtHR JUDGMENTS**

### **Standard Structure of ECtHR Cases:**

|**Section**              |**What it Contains**                                       |**Should You Read It?**                             |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|**Procedure**            |How case went through national system and reached ECtHR    |❌ **SKIP** - Not needed                             |
|**Facts**                |✅ Story of what happened; circumstances of the case        |✅ **READ & SUMMARIZE** - Essential for understanding|
|**Relevant Domestic Law**|National law of the country involved                       |❌ **SKIP** - Not for exam                           |
|**As to the Law**        |🔶 How ECtHR interprets Convention articles; legal framework|✅ **STUDY CAREFULLY** - Most important section      |
|**Analysis**             |Court applies legal framework to specific case facts       |✅ **READ** - Shows application of principles        |
|**Article 41**           |Damages/compensation awarded                               |❌ **SKIP** - Not for exam                           |
|**Conclusion**           |Was there a violation or not?                              |✅ **READ** - Final answer                           |

### **Tips for Reading Cases:**

- Cases can be 50-70 pages long - **you don’t need to read everything**
- Focus on **“As to the Law”** section - this is where the Court teaches us
- Even 100-page judgments follow this structure - **scan efficiently**
- Write a brief summary of the facts (the “story”)
- Note the legal principles established

-----

## **THE IRAC METHOD - Legal Reasoning Structure**

Lawyers solve conflicts systematically. The **IRAC method** provides the structure:

### **I - ISSUE**

**“What is the legal problem?”**

- Identify the legal issue from the facts presented
- Usually provided in exam questions

### **R - RULE**

**“What does the law say?”**

- Which abstract rules apply?
- Found in: codification, ECHR articles, ECtHR case law
- State the relevant legal framework

### **A - ANALYSIS/APPLICATION**

**“How does the rule apply to these specific facts?”**

- Go back to the facts presented
- Apply the legal rule to the particular circumstances
- Compare rule to situation

### **C - CONCLUSION**

**“What is the answer?”**

- Violation or no violation?
- Clear final answer to the legal issue

-----

## **IRAC EXAMPLE - Article 6(3)(a) ECHR**

### **The Rule:**

Article 6(3)(a): Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right:
*“to be informed promptly in a language which he understands and in detail of the nature and cause of the accusation against him”*

### **Hypothetical Fact Pattern:**

**Facts:**

- José is Spanish, lives in Country X (EU member, ratified ECHR)
- Official language of X: French
- José **speaks** French but **cannot read** it
- November 1, 2022: Arrested for theft
- Police told him in French: “Maybe you shouldn’t take things that don’t belong to you”
- At station: Given **written** criminal charge sheet **in French** (detailed)
- One week later: Convicted at trial
- **National law of X:** “Any person charged must be informed **in writing** promptly of the accusation”

### **IRAC Application:**

**ISSUE:**
Whether José was informed properly of the nature and cause of the accusation against him, and whether there was a violation of the ECHR.

**RULE:**
Article 6(3)(a) ECHR: Everyone charged has the right to be informed promptly **in a language which he understands** and in detail of the accusation.

**ANALYSIS:**

- Article 6(3)(a) requires information in a language the accused **understands**
- José is Spanish and cannot read French
- The charge sheet was provided **only in written form** and **only in French**
- While Country X complied with its national law (written notice), it failed to comply with ECHR
- José did not understand the written French document

**CONCLUSION:**
There was a **violation** of Article 6(3)(a) ECHR because José was not informed in a language he understands.

## **Key Legal Expressions to Master**

- Typical legal thinking
- Most things are judged contextually

**“In principle… but there are exceptions”**

- Standard legal qualification

**“Balance”**

- THE key word in criminal law
- Always balancing competing interests

## **Study Tips from the Lecture**

✅ **DO:**

- Read cases on paper (develop reading skills)
- Watch web videos for structure/overview
- Use Slim Stomper consistently from Week 1
- Practice IRAC method in working groups
- Focus on “As to the Law” sections in judgments
- Ask questions in working groups

❌ **DON’T:**

## **Key Takeaway**

**Criminal procedure law is always about BALANCE:**

- State power (necessary for safety) vs. Individual rights (protection from arbitrary action)
- Efficiency vs. Fairness
- Truth-finding vs. Rights protection

This balance is assessed based on **the circumstances of each case** - this is fundamental legal thinking.
