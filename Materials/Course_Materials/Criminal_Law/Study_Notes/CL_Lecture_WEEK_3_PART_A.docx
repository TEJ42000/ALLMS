```
-   **[Direct intent]{.underline}**:

Someone acts with direct intent of causing a result if he acts because
he wants that result and believes that his actions might have that
result

-   [Intermediate goal:]{.underline} must happen in order to achieve
    final goal

-   Direct intent covers both motive (final goal) and the intermediate
    goal

-   [Test of failure:]{.underline}

-   Would his act have been a failure if the result had not happened

-   Yes = direct intent

```
-   **[Indirect intent]{.underline}**:

Someone acts with indirect intent of causing a result if he acts whilst
being virtually certain that the result will happen

-   Acts despite of being aware

-   Virtually certain: 90% sure

```
-   **[Conditional intent:]{.underline}**

Someone acts with conditional intent of causing a result if he acts
whilst consciously accepting a (considerable) chance that the result
will happen

-   Conscious acceptance of a chance of causing the result:

1.  Conscious: cognitive component

2.  Acceptance: volitional component

Proof of intent:

1.  Confession: a suspect might give insight into his state of mind
    during the crime

2.  From act to mens rea:

-   An ordinary person acting like this would know that her conduct
    could lead to the result

-   The defendant has the capabilities of an ordinary person

-   Therefore, it is plausible to infer that the defendant was conscious
    of the chance that her conduct would lead to the result and that she
    accepted the result by acting like that

-   Although insane or intoxicated people may act irrationally, they are
    usually capable of acting intentionally

NEGLIGENCE:

-   Two stages of negligence:

1.  Objective stage: did the defendant's conduct grossly deviate from
    the conduct of a reasonable person?

-   A gross deviation from the reasonable standard of care is required

-   Conduct offence may be used to determine what is reasonable

-   Probability of harm is important

-   Justifiable risks are reasonable

-   Compare the defendant with a reasonable person with the same
    abilities or knowledge

2.  Subjective stage: could the defendant have acted like a reasonable
    person?

-   Acute physical or mental disabilities

-   Mental diseases

-   Chronic physical disabilities

-   Young or old age
