## Lecture Notes - Week 2

-----

## 📋 LECTURE OVERVIEW

**Topic**: Criminal Investigations and Human Rights  
**Focus Areas**:

- Criminal investigations as the first stage of criminal procedure
- Article 5 ECHR (Right to Liberty and Security) - **Arrest & Detention**
- Article 8 ECHR (Right to Privacy) - **Search & Seizure**

-----

## 🔄 RECAP: Key Distinctions from Week 1

### Substantive Criminal Law vs. Criminal Procedure Law

**Substantive Criminal Law**:

- Focuses on **WHAT** is criminal behavior
- Defines prohibited conduct
- Asks: “What conduct is criminal?”

**Criminal Procedure Law**:

- Focuses on **HOW** to respond to crime
- Process from discovery to sanction
- Asks: “How do we get to the right sanction for the right person?”

### Two Models of Criminal Justice

|**INQUISITORIAL MODEL**                        |**ADVERSARIAL MODEL**                      |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
|**Active judge** - asks questions              |**Passive judge** - referee role           |
|**Vertical relationship** (state vs. defendant)|**Horizontal relationship** (equal parties)|
|Defendant as **object** of investigation       |Defendant as **equal party**               |
|**Written case file** central                  |**Oral presentation** in court             |
|State best equipped to find truth              |Adversaries debating finds truth           |
|Evidence collected in case file                |Evidence presented in courtroom            |
|**Example**: Netherlands, Germany, France      |**Example**: UK, USA                       |

**Note**: Modern systems are converging due to ECHR influence - defendants now have stronger rights even in inquisitorial systems.

## 🔍 CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS

### Definition

An initial inquiry by officers to:

1. Establish facts and circumstances of a suspected crime
1. Identify those involved
1. Preserve any evidence related to the crime

### Primary Objective

**Finding the truth** - BUT this must be balanced against fundamental rights protection

### How Investigations Start

- Witnesses report to police
- Victims report to police
- Police acting on information they obtained
- Discovery by police during regular duties

-----

## 🛠️ INVESTIGATIVE MEASURES

### Categories of Investigative Measures

**1. Collection of Testimonial Evidence**

- Interrogations of suspects
- Questioning witnesses
- Questioning victims

**2. Surveillance**

- CCTV cameras
- Physical observation
- Electronic monitoring

**3. Search & Seizure**

- Searching houses, cars, offices
- Bodily searches
- Seizure of physical evidence

**4. Arrest & Pre-trial Detention**

- Stopping a person
- Arrest (handcuffing)
- Police custody
- Pre-trial detention

**5. Special Investigative Techniques**

- Interception of communications
- Undercover operations/secret agents
- DNA investigations
- Blood/urine samples

### COERCIVE MEASURES ⚠️

**Definition**: Investigative measures that infringe on human/constitutional rights WITHOUT the person’s consent

**Characteristics**:

- Can be applied by force
- Restrict fundamental rights
- Require special legal justification

**Examples**:

- Identity checks (forced to stop)
- Arrest (restriction of movement)
- Police custody/detention (deprivation of liberty)
- Interception of communications (privacy)
- Search of home/body (privacy)
- DNA collection (bodily integrity)

**Dutch Example - “Lokfiets” (Bait Bike)**:

- Police leave unlocked bicycle
- Has tracking sensor
- Used to catch bicycle thieves
- ✅ Approved by Supreme Court: Not considered entrapment because police don’t actively push someone to commit theft

-----

## ⚖️ THE FUNDAMENTAL BALANCE

### The Central Tension in Criminal Procedure

```
STATE POWERS              vs.        INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS
(Finding Truth)                     (Presumption of Innocence)
    
Arrest                              Article 5 (Liberty)
Detention                           Article 6 (Fair Trial)
Search                              Article 8 (Privacy)
Seizure                             Human Dignity
```

**Key Principle**: Finding the truth is NOT the only objective - it must ALWAYS be balanced against fundamental rights that must be respected regardless of offense severity.

### Historical Context: Why This Balance Matters

**15th-16th Century**:

- Absolute monarchies in Europe
- Torture was normal to obtain confessions
- No rights for accused persons

**Post-WWII Development**:

- Human rights become central
- Torture prohibited absolutely
- Defense rights strengthened

**Modern Challenge**:

- AI and new technologies
- Mass surveillance capabilities
- Question: Do we have a “right to commit crimes” if everything is monitored 100%?

-----

## 🔒 ARTICLE 5 ECHR: RIGHT TO LIBERTY AND SECURITY

### Article 5(1) - The Starting Point

**Core Principle**: “Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person”

**Rule**: “No one shall be deprived of his liberty SAVE in the following cases…”

### When Can Liberty Be Taken? Article 5(1)(c)

**The Criminal Justice Exception**:
Liberty can be taken for:

1. **Purpose**: Bringing person before competent legal authority
1. **On basis of**: REASONABLE SUSPICION of having committed an offence
1. **Or**: When reasonably necessary to prevent committing an offence OR fleeing

### ⭐ REASONABLE SUSPICION - Key Standard

**Definition**: Objective facts or information that would convince a **NEUTRAL OBSERVER** that the person committed a crime

**Examples**:

- ✅ Man running from bank with smoking gun and bag of money = REASONABLE SUSPICION
- ❌ Man walking down street who “doesn’t look right” = NOT REASONABLE SUSPICION

**Importance**: This is the legal barrier separating a free society from a police state

-----

## ⏱️ ARTICLE 5(3): THE “PROMPTLY” REQUIREMENT

### The Rule: Brought Before a Judge

**Article 5(3) Requirements**:

1. Must be brought **PROMPTLY** before a judge (or other judicial officer)
1. Entitled to trial within reasonable time OR release pending trial

### Why a Judge?

**Critical Reasons**:

1. **Independence** from state powers
1. **Impartiality** - neutral assessment
1. **Protection** - only state officer you can rely on as suspect

**Judge’s Role**:

- Check if arrest was lawful
- Verify reasonable suspicion exists
- Decide if continued detention is justified

-----

## ⚖️ LANDMARK CASE: BROGAN v. UK (1988)

### Facts

- **4 suspects** arrested under Terrorism Act (UK)
- Held in detention WITHOUT being brought before judge:
  - Person A: **5 days, 11 hours**
  - Person B: **6 days, 16.5 hours**
  - Person C: **4 days, 6 hours**
  - Person D: **4 days, 11 hours**
- All released without charges
- Mr. Brogan (shortest detention) complained

### Issue

What does “promptly” mean under Article 5(3)?

### Holding

**VIOLATION of Article 5(3)** - Even 4 days, 6 hours is TOO LONG

### Court’s Reasoning

“The scope for flexibility in interpreting and applying the notion of promptness is **VERY LIMITED**”

**Established Rule**:

- ⏰ **MAXIMUM 4 DAYS** = “Promptly”
- Even in terrorism cases (court acknowledged seriousness but law doesn’t stretch)

### What This Means

**What it DOES require**:
✅ Within 4 days: Suspect must see a judge who checks if arrest was lawful

**What it DOES NOT require**:
❌ Criminal investigation must end in 4 days
❌ Suspect must be released after 4 days

**After 4 days**:

- Investigation can continue
- Suspect can remain in detention
- BUT: Must have judicial authorization and periodic review

-----

## 📅 TWO “REASONABLE TIME” REQUIREMENTS - Don’t Confuse!

### 1️⃣ Article 5(3) - Reasonable Time to TRIAL

**Scope**: From arrest until trial begins  
**About**: Length of PRE-TRIAL DETENTION  
**Case**: Letellier v. France

**Key Points**:

- How long can you be held in pre-trial detention?
- Must be brought to trial within reasonable time
- Longer than “promptly” (4 days)
- Depends on case circumstances
- Can be months or even years if justified

### 2️⃣ Article 6(1) - Reasonable Time for PROCEEDINGS

**Scope**: From criminal charge until final conviction  
**About**: Total length of ENTIRE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE  
**Case**: Vendittelli v. Italy (your Week 1 case)

**Different criteria and much longer timeframes**

-----

## 📱 ARTICLE 5: Additional Protections

### Article 5(2) - Right to Information

**Everyone arrested must be informed**:

- **PROMPTLY** (quickly, in simple terms)
- In a **language they understand**
- Of **reasons for arrest**
- Of any **charges against them**

### Article 5(4) - Habeas Corpus

**Right to challenge detention**:

- Can apply for judicial review of detention
- Court checks: Is detention still lawful?
- Court checks: Is there still reasonable suspicion?
- Must be decided **SPEEDILY**
- Can apply multiple times during detention

**Example**: Miss Letellier used this in Letellier v. France

-----

## 🏠 ARTICLE 8 ECHR: RIGHT TO PRIVACY

### Article 8(1) - The Protected Rights

**“Everyone has the right to respect for”**:

1. **Private life**
1. **Family life**
1. **Home**
1. **Correspondence**

### What These Terms Mean (Extended Interpretations)

**HOME** (Niemetz v. Germany):

- Not just your house
- Includes: Workspace, offices, home office
- Covers: “Where you live your private life”

**CORRESPONDENCE**:

- Traditional: Letters
- Modern: Email, WhatsApp, Signal, all digital messages

**PRIVATE LIFE**:

- Personal data
- Medical records
- Digital footprint
- Everything else relating to personal sphere

**FAMILY LIFE**:

- Relations with family members
- Family relationships

-----

## 🚧 ARTICLE 8(2): When Can Privacy Be Interfered With?

### The Three-Step Test (MANDATORY STRUCTURE)

When state wants to interfere with privacy (search, surveillance, etc.), it must pass ALL THREE tests:

### ✅ STEP 1: In Accordance with Law

**Requirements**:

1. Must be basis in **national law**
1. Law must be of **good quality**:
- Enacted properly by legislator
- **Foreseeable** (people can foresee state can do this)
- **Accessible** (people can consult the law)

**Case**: Kahn v. UK (discusses quality of law)

### ✅ STEP 2: Legitimate Aim

**Must be in interests of** (Article 8(2) list):

- National security
- Public safety
- Economic well-being of country
- **Prevention of disorder or crime** ⭐ (most relevant for criminal investigations)
- Protection of health or morals
- Protection of rights and freedoms of others

**Note**: “Prevention of disorder or crime” is very broad - usually satisfied

### ✅ STEP 3: Necessary in Democratic Society

**PROPORTIONALITY TEST** - This is where cases are often decided!

**Key Questions**:

- Is the intrusion proportionate to the crime being investigated?
- Is it the least intrusive means available?
- Does it balance state interest vs. individual rights?

**Examples**:

- ❌ Searching entire house for stolen bicycle = DISPROPORTIONATE
- ✅ Tapping phone in major drug trafficking case = PROPORTIONATE

**For HIGH intrusions**: **JUDICIAL WARRANT required**

**Why judicial warrant?**

- Judge is independent and impartial
- Provides objective assessment
- Protects against abuse

-----

## 🎯 EXAM STRUCTURE: How to Analyze Article 8 Issues

### IRAC Method for Article 8 Questions

**ISSUE**: Is the search/interference in conformity with Article 8 ECHR?

**RULE**: Article 8 three-step test:

1. Was there an interference with private life/home/correspondence?
- Extended interpretation (Niemetz v. Germany)
1. If yes, was interference by public authority justified?
   a. In accordance with law (quality - Kahn v. UK)
   b. Legitimate aim (Art 8(2) interests)
   c. Necessary in democratic society (proportionality + warrant if high intrusion)

**ANALYSIS**: Apply facts to each step systematically

**CONCLUSION**: Does it violate Article 8 or is it justified?

-----

## 📱 PRACTICAL SCENARIO: The “Green Light” Case

### The Scenario

**Leo** (student) is selling cannabis near university library via “Green Light” app

**Police Action**:

1. Officer sees Leo taking cash, handing over package
1. **Arrests Leo** on reasonable suspicion (Article 5 applies)
1. Leo brought promptly before judge (within 4 days - Brogan rule)
1. Leo in police custody

**Police Problem**: Have suspect, but need evidence

**Police Want To**:

1. Search pockets and backpack
1. Search apartment
1. Unlock and read phone messages

### Question: Are These Actions Allowed Under Article 8?

-----

## 🔍 ANALYSIS 1: Search Pockets & Backpack

### IRAC Analysis

**ISSUE**: Search of pockets/backpack in conformity with Article 8?

**RULES**: Article 8 three-step test

**ANALYSIS**:

**Step 1**: Interference with Art 8(1) rights?

- ✅ YES - Private life involved

**Step 2**: By public authority?

- ✅ YES - Police

**Step 2a**: In accordance with law?

- ✅ YES (presumed in scenario)

**Step 2b**: Legitimate aim?

- ✅ YES - Prevention of disorder/crime

**Step 2c**: Necessary in democratic society?

- **Level of intrusion**: LOW
- Looking for drugs/cash/evidence
- Not highly intrusive
- **Proportionate** to drug dealing investigation
- **NO judicial warrant needed** (low intrusion)

**CONCLUSION**: ✅ **ALLOWED** - Proportionate and justified under Article 8

-----

## 🏠 ANALYSIS 2: Search Leo’s Apartment

### IRAC Analysis

**ISSUE**: Search of apartment in conformity with Article 8?

**RULES**: Article 8 three-step test

**ANALYSIS**:

**Step 1**: Interference with Art 8(1) rights?

- ✅ YES - **HOME** (explicitly protected)

**Step 2**: By public authority?

- ✅ YES - Police

**Step 2a**: In accordance with law?

- ✅ YES (presumed)

**Step 2b**: Legitimate aim?

- ✅ YES - Prevention of disorder/crime

**Step 2c**: Necessary in democratic society?

- **Level of intrusion**: **HIGH** ⚠️
- Police in someone’s home = major intrusion
- **REQUIRES JUDICIAL WARRANT** (independent, impartial judge permission)
- Must be proportionate to case (large-scale operation?)

**CONCLUSION**: ✅ **ALLOWED IF**:

- Judicial warrant obtained
- Proportionate to scale of drug operation
- Otherwise: ❌ **VIOLATES** Article 8

-----

## 📲 ANALYSIS 3: Unlock & Read Phone

### IRAC Analysis

**ISSUE**: Unlocking phone and reading messages in conformity with Article 8?

**RULES**: Article 8 three-step test

**ANALYSIS**:

**Step 1**: Interference with Art 8(1) rights?

- ✅ YES - **CORRESPONDENCE** (messages)
- Also: **PRIVATE LIFE** (entire life in phone)

**Step 2**: By public authority?

- ✅ YES - Police

**Step 2a**: In accordance with law?

- Complex issue - depends on scope of search

**Step 2b**: Legitimate aim?

- ✅ YES - Prevention of disorder/crime

**Step 2c**: Necessary in democratic society?

- **Level of intrusion**: **EXTREMELY HIGH** 🚨
- “Our entire lives are in our phones”
- Difference between:
  - Limited check of specific app ≠ Full phone search
  - Checking photos, messages, history = massive intrusion

-----

## 📱 DUTCH LAW ON PHONE SEARCHES

### Current Dutch Legal Position

**Article 94 Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure**:

- General power to **seize objects**
- BUT: Seizure ≠ Searching contents!

### Dutch Supreme Court Ruling

**Key Finding**:
“Searching full contents of phone could provide **virtually complete picture** of someone’s private life”

**Principle**: “The deeper the intrusion, the higher the required legal authority”

**Current Rules**:

- ✅ **LIMITED check**: Can use general police powers
- ❌ **FULL search** (messages, photos, history):
  - Requires **JUDICIAL WARRANT**
  - Requires **specific legal basis**

### Can Police Force You to Unlock Phone? 🔐

**Depends on lock type!**

**Privilege Against Self-Incrimination** (Article 6 ECHR):

- You don’t have to collaborate with investigations
- Cannot be forced to provide evidence against yourself

**Key Distinction** (Saunders v. UK):

1. **Evidence dependent on will** = PROTECTED
- Anything in your brain (statements, passwords, PIN codes)
- You choose to reveal it orally
1. **Evidence independent of will** = NOT PROTECTED
- Physical evidence that “just exists”
- DNA, blood, hair, fingerprints
- Can be taken against your will

### PRACTICAL IMPLICATION ⚠️

|Lock Type                       |Can Police Force Unlock?       |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|**PIN code**                    |❌ NO - Protected (in your mind)|
|**Password**                    |❌ NO - Protected (in your mind)|
|**Biometric** (fingerprint/face)|✅ YES - Physical characteristic|

**💡 LESSON: Protect your phone with PASSWORD, not biometric!**

**After Unlocking**:

- Still need judicial warrant for full search
- Search must be proportionate
- Cannot just browse all content without justification

## 📊 LEVELS OF INTRUSION - Quick Reference

### Understanding Proportionality

|Intrusion Level   |Example                                |Warrant Needed?                  |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|**LOW**           |Pocket search, backpack                |Usually NO                       |
|**MEDIUM**        |Car search, office desk                |Depends                          |
|**HIGH**          |Home search, enter premises            |**YES - Judicial**               |
|**EXTREMELY HIGH**|Full phone search, ongoing surveillance|**YES - Judicial + Specific law**|

**General Rule**: The higher the intrusion, the stronger the legal justification needed

-----

## 💡 PROFESSOR’S TIPS

### Understanding the Balance

**Remember**: Criminal procedure is ALWAYS about balance:

- State power to find truth
- Individual rights protection

**Central Question**: How can we let police investigate effectively while protecting fundamental rights?

### Common Exam Mistakes

❌ **DON’T** confuse:

- Article 5(3) reasonable time (pre-trial detention) ≠ Article 6(1) reasonable time (whole procedure)
- Seizure of object ≠ Searching its contents
- 4-day rule = time to see judge (not end of investigation or release required)

❌ **DON’T** forget:

- Judge must be independent and impartial (that’s WHY warrant from judge)
- “Promptly” has specific meaning (4 days max)
- Proportionality is key (small crime ≠ big intrusion)

✅ **DO** remember:

- Always follow IRAC structure
- Apply three-step test systematically for Article 8
- Cite relevant cases (Brogan for promptly, Niemetz for home, etc.)
- Assess level of intrusion before concluding on proportionality

### Future Challenges

**Think about**:

- AI in policing
- Mass surveillance capabilities
- Balance between security and privacy
- Do we want a world where every crime is detected 100%?

## 🎓 FINAL SUMMARY

### Article 5 in One Sentence

You can only be arrested if there’s **reasonable suspicion**, you must see a **judge within 4 days** (Brogan), and pre-trial detention must be **justified and reasonable** in length.

### Article 8 in One Sentence

Privacy can only be interfered with if it’s **lawful**, for a **legitimate aim**, and **proportionate** to that aim - with **judicial warrant** for high intrusions.

### The Core Principle

**BALANCE**: Truth-finding powers vs. Fundamental rights protection - ALWAYS.

-----

*Remember: Criminal procedure protects us all - today’s suspect could be tomorrow’s victim, and vice versa. Human rights are universal and non-negotiable.*

**Good luck with your studies! 🎯**
