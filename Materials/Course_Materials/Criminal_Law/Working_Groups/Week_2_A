# Criminal Law Working Group Notes - Legal Elements & Causation

## I. THE TRIPARTITE FRAMEWORK FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY

**This is THE fundamental structure you must memorize - the professor says “you should be able to scream this in the middle of the night!”**

### The Three Stages:

**Stage 1: Legal Elements (Actus Reus + Mens Rea)**

- Are all elements of the offense fulfilled?
- Both objective elements (actus reus - the act) AND subjective elements (mens rea - the mental state)
- **CRITICAL RULE**: Only proceed to Stage 2 if Stage 1 is fulfilled!

**Stage 2: Unlawfulness**

- Was the act unlawful?
- Are there any **justifications** (e.g., self-defense, necessity)?
- If justified → no liability

**Stage 3: Culpability/Blameworthiness**

- Can we blame the person?
- Are there any **excuses** (e.g., insanity, reasonable mistake)?
- If excused → no liability

-----

## II. THEFT - CASE STUDIES

### **Provision**:

*“Whosoever takes chattels belonging to another away from another **with the intention of unlawfully appropriating them** for himself or a third person shall be liable…”*

### Case A: Joy Sailing

**Facts**: A unties a sailboat, sails for an hour, and returns it as planned.

**Analysis**:

- **Actus Reus**: ✓ Took chattels belonging to another
- **Mens Rea**: ✗ Did NOT have intention to **unlawfully appropriate**
  - He planned to return it from the start
  - Narrow interpretation: “appropriation” = permanent deprivation

**Result**: Not liable for theft (Stage 1 not fulfilled)

**Creative Prosecution Trick**: In joyriding cases, prosecutors charged people with theft of **fuel** (which wasn’t returned) rather than the car itself!

-----

### Case B: Stolen Boat Given as Gift

**Facts**: V gives A a sailboat. A year later, police inform A the boat was stolen from C (V had no right to give it).

**Two Scenarios Based on Legal Definition**:

#### **Scenario 1: “Unlawfully” IS part of legal elements**

- **Mens Rea**: ✗ A had NO intention of **unlawfully** appropriating
  - She thought she had permission
  - **Result**: Not liable (Stage 1 not fulfilled)

#### **Scenario 2: “Unlawfully” is NOT part of legal elements**

- **Stage 1**: ✓ Legal elements fulfilled (intention to appropriate, period)
- **Stage 2**: Act was unlawful (boat belonged to C)
- **Stage 3**: Was A blameworthy?
  - **Reasonable mistake excuse** may apply
  - Should A have investigated more?
  - **Result**: Probably not liable (excused at Stage 3)

**KEY LESSON**: Where “unlawfully” appears in the provision determines at which stage liability fails - but the outcome is often the same!

-----

## III. PROPERTY DAMAGE CASES

### **Provision**:

*“Whosoever **unlawfully** damages or destroys an object belonging to another…”*

### Case C: Doctor Breaks Window to Save Life

**Facts**: Doctor breaks flower shop window to save unconscious man having heart attack.

**Analysis**:

- **Stage 1**: “Unlawfully” IS in the provision
  - Actus Reus: ✓ Damaged property
  - But was it “unlawful”? ✗ **Necessity justification** applies
  - **Result**: Not liable (Stage 1 not fulfilled)

**Alternative**: If “unlawfully” removed from provision:

- Stage 1 fulfilled → Stage 2: justification of **necessity** applies → no liability

-----

### Case D: Pushed Through Window

**Facts**: B pushes A into a window, destroying it.

**Analysis**:

- **No voluntary action** by A
- Cannot even prove actus reus
- **Result**: Not liable (Stage 1 - no voluntary act)

**KEY POINT**: We don’t even discuss mens rea or later stages because there’s no voluntary action at all!

-----

## IV. HOMICIDE & MENTAL STATES

### Case E: Self-Defense Killing

**Facts**: A kills an attacker in self-defense.

**Analysis**:

- **Stage 1**: ✓ Intention to kill present (intention is **neutral**)
- **Stage 2**: Self-defense justification applies → not unlawful
- **Result**: Not liable

**IMPORTANT**: Having intention doesn’t mean guilty - justifications can apply!

-----

### Case F: Psychotic Person Kills with Baseball Bat

**Facts**: Person with severe psychosis believes victim is possessed, kills with baseball bat.

**Analysis**:

- **Stage 1**: ✓ Intention to kill IS present
  - Even delusional people can have intention
  - Mental illness doesn’t negate intention
- **Stage 3**: **Criminal insanity excuse** applies here
- **Result**: Not liable (excused)

**KEY LESSON**: Mental disorders affect Stage 3 (culpability), NOT Stage 1 (intention)!

-----

## V. CAUSATION - TWO TYPES

**Always analyze BOTH types in order:**

### 1. **Factual Causation** (“But-For” Test)

**Question**: But for the defendant’s act, would the result have happened?

- If NO → factual causation established
- Simple causal connection test

### 2. **Legal Causation** (Reasonableness Test)

**Question**: Is it **reasonable** to attribute the result to the defendant’s act?

- Even if factual causation exists, legal causation may NOT
- Use the **8 concepts** to analyze

-----

## VI. THE 8 LEGAL CAUSATION CONCEPTS

### **1. Culpability of Perpetrator**

- If defendant intended the result → usually reasonable to attribute
- Strong argument for causation

### **2. Probability of Result**

- Was the result highly unlikely/bizarre?
- If YES → may break causal chain
- If NO → supports causation

### **3. Naturally Intervening Cause**

- Did nature intervene (lightning, earthquake)?
- Usually breaks causal chain (too bizarre)

### **4. Responsive Intervening Cause**

- Did the intervening cause occur **in response** to defendant’s act?
- If YES → usually still reasonable to attribute
- **Exception**: Only breaks chain if highly abnormal/bizarre

### **5. Commonly Required Medical Treatment**

- Medical treatment needed due to defendant’s act?
- Usually maintains causal chain
- Victim’s presence in hospital is defendant’s fault

### **6. Culpable Human Intervention**

- Did a third party’s highly culpable act intervene?
- Usually breaks causal chain (too independent)

### **7. Insubstantial Contribution**

- Is defendant’s contribution minor compared to intervening cause?
- May break causal chain

### **8. Actual Remoteness**

- Is the result too remote/distant from the act?
- May break causal chain

-----

## VII. CAUSATION CASE STUDIES

### Case A: Hospital Influenza

**Facts**: A stabs B → B hospitalized → B contracts influenza in hospital → B dies (was weakened by stab wound)

**Analysis**:

- **Factual**: ✓ But for stabbing, no hospital, no influenza
- **Legal**: Is it reasonable to attribute death to A?

**Concepts that Apply**:

- ✓ **Responsive intervening cause**: Hospital visit was response to stabbing
- ✓ **Commonly required medical treatment**: Had to go to hospital
- ✓ **Probability**: Contracting illness in hospital NOT bizarre
- ✓ Influenza fatal because of **weakened condition from stabbing**

**Result**: ✓ Legal causation established - reasonable to attribute death to A

-----

### Case B: Intoxicated Nurse Overdose

**Facts**: A stabs B → B hospitalized → Grossly intoxicated nurse gives huge overdose → B dies

**Analysis**:

- **Factual**: ✓ But for stabbing, no hospital exposure
- **Legal**: Is it reasonable?

**Concepts that Apply**:

- ? Responsive intervening cause (hospital visit was due to stabbing)
- **BUT**:
  - ✗ **Highly abnormal/bizarre**: Drunk nurse giving overdose is extraordinary
  - ✗ **Culpable human intervention**: Independent, highly culpable third party act

**Result**: ✗ Legal causation probably NOT established - **unreasonable** to attribute death to A

-----

### Case C: Lightning Strikes Ambulance

**Facts**: A hits B in fight → B has severe head injury (non-fatal) → Ambulance struck by lightning → B dies

**Analysis**:

- **Article X - Result Qualified Offense**:
  - Section 1: Intentional maltreatment (up to 2 years)
  - Section 2: + severe injury (up to 6 years)
  - Section 3: + death (up to 8 years)

**For Severe Injury**:

- **Factual**: ✓ Hit caused head injury
- **Legal**:
  - ✗ **Not highly unlikely**: Hitting head on curb during fight is foreseeable
  - **Result**: ✓ Causation for severe injury established

**For Death**:

- **Factual**: ✓ But for fight, wouldn’t be in ambulance
- **Legal**:
  - ✗ **Naturally intervening cause**: Lightning is bizarre/unpredictable
  - ✗ **Probability**: Highly unlikely result
  - **Result**: ✗ No legal causation for death

**Maximum Penalty**: **6 years** (Section 2 - severe injury only)

-----

### Case D: Speeding Ambulance Crash

**Facts**: A hits B with baseball bat **intending to kill** → Passerby stops A → B has severe head injury (non-fatal) → Ambulance crashes due to high speed → B dies

**Analysis**:

- **Factual**: ✓ But for attack, no ambulance trip
- **Legal**:

**Concepts that Apply**:

- ✓ **Culpability of perpetrator**: A INTENDED to kill - very strong factor!
  - “If there is intent, consequence can never be too remote”
  - A wanted B dead; B ended up dead
- ✓ **Responsive intervening cause**: Hospital trip was response to attack
- ✓ **Probability**: Ambulance speeding and crashing NOT highly bizarre

**Result**: ✓ Legal causation established for **intentional homicide**

**KEY PRINCIPLE**: When defendant intended the result, almost any causal chain is reasonable!

-----

## VIII. RESULT QUALIFIED OFFENSES

**Definition**: Offenses where mens rea applies only to the basic act, but **not** to the more severe result

**Example - Article X**:

- **Mens rea**: Intention to maltreat/harm (basic offense)
- **No mens rea required for**: Severe injury or death
- **Only need**: Causation between act and more severe result

**Why?**: Allows harsher punishment when harmful results occur, even if unintended

-----

## IX. KEY EXAM TIPS

1. **ALWAYS start with the tripartite framework** - it’s your roadmap!
1. **Don’t skip stages** - only proceed if previous stage is fulfilled
1. **Read provisions carefully** - where “unlawfully” appears matters!
1. **Intention is neutral** - having intent doesn’t automatically = guilty
1. **For causation**:

- First factual (simple but-for test)
- Then legal (use relevant concepts from the 8)
- Weigh all applicable concepts like a scale

1. **Mental illness** affects Stage 3 (excuse), not Stage 1 (intention)
1. **Be specific about which stage** you’re discussing - don’t mix them up!

-----

**Remember**: This framework will be used in almost every criminal law problem. Master it, and you’ve mastered the foundation of the course! 🎯​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
