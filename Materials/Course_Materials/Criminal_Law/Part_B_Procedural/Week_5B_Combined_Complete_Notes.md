# Week 5B Criminal Law - Complete Notes
## Article 6(3)(d) ECHR: Right to Examine Witnesses

---

## CASE LAW ANALYSIS

### Schatschaschwili v Germany

**1. Read the Grand Chamber's assessment under paras 100-109. What are the steps developed in the Al-Khawaja and Tahery judgment to examine the compatibility with Article 6(1) and 6(3)(d) of the Convention of proceedings in which of the absent witnesses' statements were used as evidence?**

**The Three-Step Test:**

**Step 1: Whether there was a good reason for non-attendance**
- The absence of good reason for the absence of the witness does not by itself make the proceedings unfair
- This is a preliminary question but not automatically conclusive
- Courts must examine whether authorities made reasonable efforts to secure witness attendance

**Step 2: Whether the absent witness's evidence was sole or decisive**
- **Sole evidence:** The only evidence supporting conviction
- **Decisive evidence:** Evidence that was crucial/determinative for the conviction, even if other evidence exists
- The Court has moved away from strict "sole or decisive rule" toward overall fairness assessment

**Step 3: Whether sufficient counterbalancing factors existed**
- Whether compensating factors are present must not only be examined in cases where the evidence is "sole or decisive" but also in cases where the evidence carries "significant weight"
- Types of counterbalancing factors:
  * Procedural safeguards (judicial warnings, careful scrutiny)
  * Corroborating evidence
  * Opportunity to challenge the evidence
  * Quality of the statement (under oath, to investigating judge, recorded)

**Important Note:** 3-step test must be performed in following order but the factors are **interrelated**, thereby allowing for flexibility regarding rearrangements

---

**2. Read paras 110-118. Why did the Court find it necessary to refine its 'Al-Khawaja-Test'?**

The court found it necessary to refine the test, as it had been misunderstood: the three steps were seen as separate questions rather than cumulative. The courts also raised an issue as the state failed to raise sufficient counterbalancing factors to secure the reliability of the evidence, raising an issue on the evidence's sole and decisive extent that would be used as evidence of the absent witness.

**Additional Context from Transcript:**

After *Al-Khawaja*, courts applied the test inconsistently:
- Some courts found violation based solely on lack of good reason
- Others took an overall approach examining all three steps
- Still others applied steps mechanically without considering interrelation
- Uncertainty about order of examination and whether steps were independent

The refinement was needed to clarify:
1. Lack of good reason â‰  automatic violation
2. Steps are interrelated, not independent silos
3. Flexibility in application based on case circumstances
4. Overall fairness is the ultimate question

---

**3. In what way did the Court clarify the 'Al Khawaja-test' in the Schatschaschwili-Judgment?**

The courts deemed that the three-step assessment shouldn't be applied mechanically but rather as a supplementary use for overall fairness assessment.

**Key Clarifications:**

**Clarification 1: No Automatic Violation**
- Absence of good reason does NOT automatically = unfair trial
- However, it is a **very important factor** to weigh in the balance
- Would contradict the purpose of moving away from indiscriminate rules

**Clarification 2: Interrelated Assessment**
- All three steps are connected and must be weighed together
- Different cases may require examining steps in different orders
- Context matters - mechanical application is inappropriate
- Exception: if witness testimony is manifestly irrelevant, lack of good reason won't violate Article 6

**Clarification 3: Importance of Pre-Trial Stage**
- Investigation stage is crucial for fair trial rights
- Evidence obtained during investigation determines framework for trial
- Article 6 applies to pre-trial proceedings if fairness of trial could be prejudiced
- Opportunity to examine witnesses at investigation stage can satisfy Article 6(3)(d)

---

**4. Why was Article 6 ECHR violated in Schatschaschwili v. Germany?**

There was a violation of Article 6 because the witnesses never appeared at trial, and Germany failed to exercise due diligence to secure their attendance, the decisive evidence in the case was derived from V2's testimony. Germany never offered sufficient counterbalancing factors to allow the applicant to question the witness. The German courts' reasoning presented problematic as well as they didn't adequately justify why witnesses couldn't attend or explain what efforts were made.

**Detailed Analysis from Transcript:**

**Facts:**
- Schatschaschwili charged with robbery in Germany
- Two key witnesses (O. and P.) were victims who gave statements to investigating judge
- Witnesses returned to Turkey and could not be located for trial
- Statements were admitted and used for conviction
- Applicant was NOT notified of witness questioning during investigation
- No lawyer appointed to represent him at that stage
- Result: Applicant NEVER had any opportunity to examine these witnesses

**Court's Step-by-Step Finding:**

**Step 1: Good Reason for Trial Non-Attendance**
- YES, there was a good reason for non-attendance at trial
- Regional Court made reasonable efforts to locate witnesses
- Witnesses had returned to Turkey and could not be found
- This step was satisfied for the trial stage

**Step 2: Sole or Decisive Evidence**
- Statements carried considerable weight in establishing guilt
- Direct eyewitness testimony from the victims
- While perhaps not "sole" evidence, very important
- Conviction relied heavily on these statements

**Step 3: Counterbalancing Factors - THE CRITICAL FAILURE**

**What Was Missing:**
- Applicant not notified about witness questioning during investigation
- No lawyer appointed to represent him at investigation stage
- Investigating judge excluded applicant "to avoid putting investigation at risk"
- Concerned witnesses were "shocked and distressed" and would be afraid

**Why This Was Fatal:**
- Applicant NEVER had ANY opportunity - neither at investigation nor at trial
- Reasons for excluding him at investigation stage were insufficient
- Could have appointed lawyer to attend witness questioning
- Could have used video link or other protective measures
- Protection of witnesses must be balanced against defense rights

**Ultimate Reasoning:**
1. While good reason existed for trial non-attendance, there was NO good reason for denying opportunity at investigation stage
2. Complete absence of any confrontation opportunity throughout entire proceedings was fundamentally unfair
3. Counterbalancing factors at trial could not compensate for total lack of any examination opportunity
4. Pre-trial stage violations fatally undermined fair trial

## WORKING GROUP CASE APPLICATIONS

### Case I

**Question:** Do you consider Article 6(3)(d) ECHR violated with regard to the examination of V? Motivate your answer by using the IRAC method.

**Issue:** Has there been a violation of Article 6(3)(d) of the ECHR?

**Rule:** Schatschaschwili v. Germany (Al-Khawaja Test)
- Was there a good reason for non-attendance/anonymity?
- Was the evidence sole or decisive?
- Were there sufficient counterbalancing factors?

**Analysis:**

**Step 1: Good Reason**
There was a good reason for witness anonymity, as its purpose was to protect the identities of undercover vice police officers. Protection of undercover officers is a legitimate law enforcement interest that can justify measures limiting confrontation rights.

**Step 2: Sole or Decisive Evidence**
Yes, the evidence was decisive as the courts state in paragraph 11, "The conviction was mainly based on V's testimony." When conviction relies predominantly on a single witness, that evidence is clearly decisive - the conviction would likely fail without it.

**Step 3: Counterbalancing Factors - INSUFFICIENT**
Counterbalancing factors were NOT sufficiently given the decisive nature of the witness's statement. The defense was never able to question V's credibility as a witness, as they could only submit questions through the judge. 

**Critical Deficiencies:**
- Audio relay prevented observation of V's demeanor
- No direct cross-examination opportunity
- Defense raised serious entrapment allegations (para 8, 10) which needed rigorous testing
- The court itself acknowledged conduct was "influenced by Officer V from the outset" (para 10)
- No evidence existed of drug dealing to anyone else (para 10)
- V's credibility and role were crucial to assess but impossible to properly challenge
- Questions submitted through judge is insufficient substitute for direct cross-examination
- Entrapment defense required ability to probe V's actions, methods, and intentions

**Conclusion:** **YES, there was a violation of Article 6(3)(d).** While the good reason for anonymity was legitimate, the decisive nature of V's testimony combined with wholly insufficient counterbalancing factors rendered the proceedings unfair. The inability to directly cross-examine on crucial entrapment issues, observe demeanor, or meaningfully challenge the witness who orchestrated the entire operation fundamentally undermined the fairness of the trial. The counterbalancing factors did not compensate for the significant handicap to the defense.

### Case II

**Question:** Has the right to examine or have examined witnesses as mentioned in Article 6(1) in conjunction with Article (3)(d) ECHR been violated by allowing X's statement as evidence for the conviction by the Security State Court? Why (not)? Motivate your answer by using the IRAC method.

**Issue:** Has there been a violation of Article 6(1) in conjunction with Article 6(3)(d) of the ECHR?

**Rule:** Schatschaschwili v. Germany (Al-Khawaja Test)
- Is there a good reason for non-attendance?
- Is the witness's testimony the sole or decisive evidence?
- Are there sufficient counterbalancing factors?

**Analysis:**

**Step 1: Good Reason - QUALIFIED YES, BUT WITH FAILURES**
Yes, the witness's state of health was poor, and he was put into hospice. Terminal illness is a legitimate good reason for inability to attend trial. 

However, while terminal illness is legitimate, the state still had obligations to secure testimony earlierâ€”X gave statements to prosecutor in September 2001 (para 9), but the applicant wasn't present/represented at that stage. **Critical failure:** Authorities knew X was seriously ill but failed to take steps to secure his testimony when he could have been examined by the defense.

**Step 2: Sole or Decisive Evidence - YES**
Yes, X's testimony is decisive evidence for armed robbery and membership of a criminal organization. Paragraph 15 explicitly states the court relied **"predominantly on X's statement"** for conviction. 

**Why This Was Decisive:**
- X was the primary victim
- His testimony was essential to prove the threatening/armed robbery elements
- The applicant's own version contradicted X's account on the key issue of threatening (para 11)
- Without X's statement, the threatening element could not be proven
- Applicant's partial confession actually contradicted X on crucial points

**Step 3: Counterbalancing Factors - WHOLLY INSUFFICIENT**
No, the defense wasn't given sufficient opportunity to question, which questions the court's diligence in examining the testimony. 

**Multiple Deficiencies:**
1. **No Opportunity at Any Stage:** Defense never had the chance to question X at any stage, and was denied when requesting X's appearance in court (paras 10, 13)

2. **Hearsay Evidence:** Additionally, Y's testimony (para 12) was hearsay from his father, and applicant couldn't comment. This compounded the confrontation problem.

3. **Pre-Trial Rights Violations:** The applicant was held 3 days without lawyer (paras 4-7) when early statements were made, which were later retracted. This violated *Salduz* principles and affected reliability of early statements.

4. **No Alternative Measures:** No alternative means were explored (video link, deposition before death) despite knowing X was terminally ill

5. **Procedural Failures:** The Court of Appeal dismissed the plea of nullity without proper examination (para 17)

6. **Untested Contradictions:** The applicant's partial confession actually contradicted X on the threatening (para 11), making X's credibility crucial but completely untested

**Applying Schatschaschwili Lessons:**
- Like *Schatschaschwili*, applicant had no opportunity at investigation or trial stage
- Unlike *Schatschaschwili*, there was a legitimate reason for trial non-attendance (death)
- BUT like *Schatschaschwili*, authorities failed to secure testimony earlier when possible
- X gave statements in September 2001, trial was much later - authorities had time to arrange examination

**Conclusion:** **YES, Article 6(1) and (3)(d) were clearly violated.** Although X's terminal illness provided a good reason for his non-attendance at trial, the authorities failed in their obligation to take adequate steps to secure his testimony at an earlier stage when he could have been examined by the defense. X's statement was sole and decisive evidence for the armed robbery and threatening convictions, yet the applicant never had any opportunity to question him at any point in the proceedingsâ€”despite requesting this twice. The counterbalancing factors were wholly insufficient: the conviction rested predominantly on completely untested evidence from the key prosecution witness, whose account the applicant disputed. No alternative means of securing testimony were explored, and the applicant's rights were further compromised by the initial 3-day period without legal assistance. This fundamentally undermined the fairness of the proceedings as a whole.

## NATSVLISHVILI AND TOGONIDZE v GEORGIA

### Plea Bargaining and ECHR Standards

**1. What are the minimum standards of the ECtHR on plea bargaining?**

The plea agreement must satisfy two core requirements:

**A. Voluntary, Knowing, and Intelligent Plea**
The plea agreement must be entered into voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. This means:

1. **Voluntariness:**
   - No coercion, pressure, or threats
   - Defendant genuinely wishes to plead guilty
   - Not driven by fear or improper inducement

2. **Knowing:**
   - Full understanding of the charges
   - Clear information about sentence implications
   - Awareness of rights being waived
   - Knowledge of evidence against them
   - Understanding of consequences

3. **Intelligent:**
   - Defendant has mental capacity to understand
   - Decision made with adequate time to consider
   - Benefit of legal advice

**B. Sufficient Judicial Oversight and Procedural Fairness**
The plea must be subject to judicial review with proper procedural safeguards:

1. **Judicial Scrutiny:**
   - Court must verify voluntariness
   - Cannot rubber-stamp agreements
   - Must ensure defendant understands implications
   - Should check factual basis for plea

2. **Legal Assistance:**
   - Effective legal representation essential
   - Lawyer must advise on plea implications
   - Opportunity for private consultation with lawyer
   - Lawyer should be present during plea

3. **Procedural Safeguards:**
   - Public hearing (in most cases)
   - Opportunity to withdraw plea if circumstances change
   - Clear record of plea proceedings
   - Proportionate sentence reduction

**Additional Standards:**
- Defendant must not be misled about sentence
- "Trial penalty" must not be so severe it coerces innocent pleas
- Balance between efficiency and justice must be maintained
- Individual rights protected throughout

---

**2. Read the Court's assessment under paras 90-103. Was Article 6(1) violated? Why (not)?**

**Answer:** No, Article 6(1) was not violated in the first applicant's plea bargain, as the plea was entered voluntarily with proper legal assistance and the applicant was fully aware of its consequences.

**Detailed Analysis from Case:**

**First Applicant (Natsvlishvili) - NO VIOLATION**

**Why No Violation:**
1. **Voluntary Decision:**
   - Applicant initiated plea discussions
   - Had multiple consultations with lawyer
   - Understood he was waiving trial rights
   - No evidence of coercion or pressure

2. **Adequate Information:**
   - Fully informed of charges and evidence
   - Understood sentence implications
   - Aware of alternative of going to trial
   - Had time to consider decision

3. **Effective Legal Representation:**
   - Represented by lawyer throughout
   - Lawyer advised on pros and cons
   - Private consultations occurred
   - Lawyer present during plea

4. **Judicial Oversight:**
   - Court verified voluntariness
   - Examined factual basis for plea
   - Ensured applicant understood consequences
   - Proper procedural safeguards followed

5. **Proportionate Sentence:**
   - Sentence reduction was reasonable
   - Not so severe as to coerce plea
   - Reflected guilty plea and cooperation

**Second Applicant (Togonidze) - DIFFERENT OUTCOME**
*Note: The second applicant's situation may have been different - check specific paragraphs for complete analysis*

**Key Principles from This Case:**

1. **Procedural Fairness is Essential:**
   - Even in negotiated justice, full procedural protections required
   - Guilty plea doesn't mean abandoning all rights

2. **Quality of Legal Assistance Matters:**
   - Lawyer must be competent and engaged
   - Adequate time for consultation crucial
   - Lawyer should independently assess case

3. **Judicial Role is Active:**
   - Judge is not passive accepter of pleas
   - Must actively verify voluntariness
   - Should examine factual basis
   - Cannot rubber-stamp agreements

4. **Context of Legal System:**
   - Plea bargaining relatively new in many European systems
   - Safeguards must prevent abuse
   - Balance efficiency with justice

## COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### How to Approach Article 6(3)(d) Questions

**Step 1: Identify the Issue**
- Who is the absent/anonymous witness?
- What did their evidence establish?
- When and how was evidence taken?
- Did defendant have any opportunity to examine?

**Step 2: Apply Three-Step Test Systematically**

**A. Good Reason Analysis:**
- State the reason for non-attendance/anonymity
- Evaluate whether authorities made reasonable efforts
- Consider **entire proceedings** (investigation + trial)
- Don't just look at trial - pre-trial opportunities matter

**Questions to Ask:**
- Was witness available at any stage?
- Did authorities know witness might become unavailable?
- Were alternative measures considered?
- Is reason for absence attributable to state?

**B. Sole or Decisive Analysis:**
- What other evidence exists?
- Could conviction stand without this evidence?
- How did court rely on the evidence?

**Assessment:**
- Look for language like "mainly based on," "predominantly," "crucial"
- Consider whether conviction would likely fail without it
- Even if not "sole," could be "decisive"

**C. Counterbalancing Analysis:**
- What procedural safeguards existed?
- Was there corroborating evidence?
- Could defendant challenge in other ways?
- Were there pre-trial opportunities?

**Key Counterbalancing Factors:**
- Judicial warnings about untested evidence
- Detailed reasoning by court
- Other witnesses on same facts
- Physical/documentary corroboration
- Defendant's ability to present alternative narrative
- Quality of statement (oath, investigating judge, video)
- Statement made shortly after events

**Step 3: Overall Fairness Assessment**
- Step back from individual steps
- Consider proceedings as a whole
- Weigh all factors together
- Consider any special circumstances

**Critical Questions:**
- Did defendant have meaningful opportunity to challenge evidence?
- Was the trial fundamentally fair despite limitations?
- Were competing interests properly balanced?
- Did violations at one stage compound problems at another?

## KEY DISTINCTIONS TO UNDERSTAND

### Absent vs. Anonymous Witnesses

| Absent Witnesses | Anonymous Witnesses |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Not present at trial | Present but identity hidden |
| Issue: inability to examine | Issue: inability to assess credibility fully |
| *Al-Khawaja*/*Schatschaschwili* test | Different balancing test |
| Focus on opportunity to confront | Focus on protection necessity vs. defense rights |

### Investigation Stage vs. Trial Stage

**Why Both Matter:**

**Investigation Stage:**
- Foundation for entire case
- Evidence gathered shapes trial
- Article 6 applies if fairness affected
- Opportunity here can satisfy confrontation right
- *Salduz* principles apply (right to lawyer)

**Trial Stage:**
- Public adversarial proceeding
- Preferred venue for witness examination
- But not always possible
- Can be compensated if investigation stage was fair

**Critical Principle from Schatschaschwili:**
Must have opportunity at **some stage** - no opportunity at any stage is strong indication of unfairness

### Sole vs. Decisive Evidence

**Sole Evidence:**
- Only evidence supporting conviction
- Relatively rare in practice
- Clear-cut determination
- Almost always violation without counterbalancing

**Decisive Evidence:**
- Not the only evidence
- But conviction would likely fail without it
- Or would be significantly weakened
- More common and harder to assess
- Requires careful analysis

**Practical Test:**
"Would the court have convicted without this evidence?"
- "Probably not" â†’ decisive
- "Yes, definitely" â†’ not decisive  
- "Maybe" â†’ court must carefully assess

## CONNECTIONS TO OTHER COURSE WEEKS

### Link to Week 3: Criminal Investigations

**Connections:**
- Week 3 covered *Salduz* (right to lawyer during investigation)
- Week 5B emphasizes importance of investigation stage for witness examination
- Both show Article 6 applies before trial
- Pre-trial rights violations affect fair trial

**Integration:**
- If defendant denied lawyer during investigation (*Salduz* violation)
- AND key witnesses examined without defense present (Week 5B issue)
- = Compounded violation of fair trial rights

**Example from Case II:**
- Applicant held 3 days without lawyer (Week 3 issue)
- X's statement taken without defense present (Week 5B issue)
- Combined effect: fundamentally unfair proceedings

### Link to Week 4: Evidence, Burden of Proof, Defenses

**Connections:**
- Week 4 covered burden of proof and presumption of innocence
- Week 5B deals with quality and reliability of evidence
- Untested evidence affects ability to meet "beyond reasonable doubt" standard

**Integration:**
- Can conviction be "beyond reasonable doubt" based on untested evidence?
- How do counterbalancing factors relate to evidence quality?
- Defendant's inability to challenge evidence affects presumption of innocence

### Link to Week 6: Participation in Crime

**Connections:**
- Week 6 covers accomplice liability (instigation, aiding, co-perpetration)
- Often relies on accomplice or co-defendant testimony
- What if accomplice is the absent witness?
- Special concerns about reliability of accomplice testimony

**Special Considerations:**
- Accomplices have incentive to shift blame
- Their testimony requires careful scrutiny
- Inability to cross-examine accomplice particularly prejudicial
- Need strong corroboration when relying on accomplice testimony

## EXAM STRATEGY AND TIPS

### Time Management for Article 6(3)(d) Questions

**Recommended Allocation (for 45-minute question):**
- **5 minutes:** Read carefully, identify all issues
- **10 minutes:** Outline your answer with key points
- **25 minutes:** Write full IRAC analysis
- **5 minutes:** Review, refine, check completeness

### IRAC Structure Template

**ISSUE (2-3 sentences):**
"The issue is whether the admission of [witness]'s statement violated the accused's right to a fair trial under Article 6(1) and 6(3)(d) ECHR, given that [witness] did not testify at trial and the accused had no opportunity to examine them at any stage of the proceedings."

**RULE (1 substantial paragraph):**
State the three-step *Al-Khawaja*/*Schatschaschwili* test:
1. Good reason for non-attendance
2. Sole or decisive evidence
3. Counterbalancing factors

Add: "These steps are interrelated and must be assessed in light of the overall fairness of the proceedings. The absence of good reason is not automatically conclusive but is a very important factor. The Court must examine the proceedings as a whole, considering both investigation and trial stages."

**ANALYSIS (3-4 paragraphs - one per step + overall):**

*Good Reason Paragraph:*
- State facts about why witness was absent
- Evaluate whether authorities made reasonable efforts
- Consider entire proceedings (investigation + trial)
- Apply case law
- Conclude on this step

*Sole or Decisive Paragraph:*
- Identify what other evidence exists
- Assess weight/importance of absent witness statement
- Determine if conviction could stand without it
- Apply relevant language from facts
- Note even if not "sole," could be "decisive"

*Counterbalancing Paragraph:*
- List procedural safeguards present (or absent)
- Evaluate corroborating evidence
- Assess defense opportunities to challenge
- Consider pre-trial opportunities
- Weigh quality of statement
- Note any compounding violations

*Overall Fairness Paragraph:*
- Step back from individual steps
- Consider proceedings as a whole
- Weigh all three steps together
- Consider special circumstances
- Balance competing interests

**CONCLUSION (1 paragraph):**
"Therefore, the admission of the absent witness statement [did/did not] violate Article 6(1) and 6(3)(d) because [summarize key reasons]. The proceedings [were/were not] fair when considered as a whole."

## QUICK REFERENCE - THE THREE-STEP TEST

### Memory Aid: The Al-Khawaja/Schatschaschwili Test

**STEP 1: GOOD REASON?**
- Valid justification for absence?
- Reasonable efforts made by authorities?
- Consider entire proceedings (not just trial)
- Lack of good reason = very important factor (but not automatic violation)

**Examples of Good Reasons:**
âœ“ Death, serious illness
âœ“ Genuine fear (with evidence)
âœ“ Disappeared despite efforts
âœ“ Protection of undercover officers
âœ— Mere inconvenience
âœ— Administrative failures
âœ— Insufficient efforts

**STEP 2: SOLE OR DECISIVE?**
- Only evidence? (sole)
- Crucial/determinative evidence? (decisive)
- Would conviction stand without it?
- Look for language: "mainly based," "predominantly," "crucial"

**STEP 3: COUNTERBALANCING?**
- Procedural safeguards?
- Corroborating evidence?
- Defense opportunities?
- Pre-trial examination?
- Quality of statement?

**Key Counterbalancing Factors:**
âœ“ Judicial warnings
âœ“ Careful reasoning
âœ“ Other witnesses
âœ“ Physical evidence
âœ“ Defense narrative
âœ“ Statement under oath
âœ“ Early statement
âœ— Hearsay on hearsay
âœ— No opportunity at any stage
âœ— No corroboration
âœ— Rubber-stamp acceptance

**OVERALL: FAIRNESS**
- Steps are interrelated
- Not mechanical application
- Whole proceedings matter
- Context is critical
- Balance competing interests

## ADDITIONAL PRACTICE SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: The Deceased Expert

**Facts:**
- Murder trial
- Medical expert gave detailed report during investigation on cause of death
- Expert died before trial
- Report admitted as evidence
- Defense has own expert who contests findings
- Other circumstantial evidence points to defendant

**Quick Analysis:**
- **Good reason:** YES (death)
- **Sole/decisive:** Need to assess - expert opinion crucial in murder, but is it decisive if contested?
- **Counterbalancing:** Defense has own expert (strong factor), detailed written report, other evidence exists
- **Likely Outcome:** NO violation if strong counterbalancing

**Key Factors:**
- Defense ability to present alternative expert crucial
- Written report allows some challenge to methodology
- Not sole basis for conviction
- Presence of own expert is significant counterbalancing

---

### Scenario 2: The Intimidated Witness

**Facts:**
- Witness to assault gave statement to police
- Received threats before trial
- Too frightened to attend
- No protective measures offered
- Statement used for conviction
- No other direct witnesses

**Quick Analysis:**
- **Good reason:** QUALIFIED - intimidation is valid concern, BUT did authorities try protective measures?
- **Sole/decisive:** YES (only direct evidence of assault)
- **Counterbalancing:** WEAK - no corroboration, no opportunity at any stage, no protective alternatives tried
- **Likely Outcome:** VIOLATION

**Critical Issues:**
- Authorities' obligation to try video link, screens, anonymity
- Sole direct evidence makes counterbalancing essential
- Failure to explore alternatives = insufficient good reason
- Defendant penalized for third-party threats

---

### Scenario 3: Investigation Stage Examination

**Facts:**
- Witness gave statement to investigating judge
- Defense lawyer present and cross-examined
- Witness died before trial
- Statement properly recorded
- Statement admitted at trial

**Quick Analysis:**
- **Good reason:** YES (death)
- **Opportunity at investigation:** YES (key difference from other scenarios)
- **Confrontation satisfied:** Defense had opportunity to examine
- **Likely Outcome:** NO violation

**Following Cases:**
- *Sommer v. Italy*
- *Chmura v. Poland*
- *Aigner v. Austria*

**Key Principle:**
Opportunity at investigation stage can fully satisfy Article 6(3)(d), even if witness unavailable at trial
