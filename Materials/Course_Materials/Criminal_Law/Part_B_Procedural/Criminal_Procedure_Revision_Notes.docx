*Lecture Notes - Part B*

I. REVIEW OF KEY ECHR ARTICLES

Article 5 ECHR - Right to Liberty and Security

**General Rule:** Everyone has the right to liberty and security. State
CANNOT deprive liberty except in specific situations listed in Article
5(1).

Key Exception: Article 5(1)(c)

-   Arrest and pretrial detention for bringing before competent legal
    authority

-   Exceptions are exhaustive (closed list) and interpreted strictly

Article 5(3) - Promptness Requirement

**Rule:** When arrested, person must be brought *\"promptly\"* before a
judge

> **📌 Brogan and Others v. UK:** \"Promptly\" means approximately 4
> DAYS maximum. Even terrorism cases don\'t justify longer periods
> without judicial oversight.

-   [x] Within 4 days = generally acceptable

-   ✗ Beyond 4 days = likely violation

-   **Purpose:** Prevents arbitrary detention and ensures judicial
    oversight quickly

Article 5(3) - Reasonable Time for Trial

**Rule:** Once detained pretrial, person has right to trial within
reasonable time OR release pending trial

> **📌 Letellier v. France:** \"Reasonable time\" depends on
> case-by-case assessment considering complexity and seriousness.

-   Simple shoplifting → shorter time required

-   Complex financial fraud → longer time acceptable

Article 8 ECHR - Right to Privacy

**Article 8(1):** Everyone has the right to respect for private and
family life, home, and correspondence.

**Article 8(2):** State can interfere IF:

1.  **In accordance with law** (accessible, foreseeable, sufficient
    quality)

2.  **For legitimate aim** (public safety, prevention of crime, etc.)

3.  **Proportionate/necessary**

> **📌 Niemietz v. Germany:**

-   \"Home\" interpreted broadly → includes business premises,
    > professional offices

-   \"Correspondence\" includes emails, phone communications

-   Any search must be proportionate

> **📌 Klass v. Germany:** Law must be of \"sufficient quality\" with
> clear provisions, safeguards against abuse, and independent oversight.

Privilege Against Self-Incrimination

**Core Principle:** Cannot be forced to provide evidence against
yourself (part of Article 6 fair trial rights)

Two Categories of Evidence

**[1. Evidence Depending on Will of Accused]{.underline}**

-   **PROTECTED** by privilege

-   Examples: Spoken statements, written confessions, testimony

-   Cannot be compelled

**[2. Evidence with Independent Existence]{.underline}**

-   **Generally NOT PROTECTED**

-   Examples: DNA samples, blood samples, fingerprints

-   Rationale: Exists independently of your will

⚠️ CRITICAL EXCEPTION: Jalloh v. Germany

> **JALLOH RULE:** When evidence is inside the body and extracting it
> violates Article 3 (inhuman/degrading treatment), the privilege
> against self-incrimination DOES apply.

-   **Facts:** Police forcibly administered emetic to make suspect vomit
    drugs

-   **Holdings:**

    -   Article 3 violation (inhuman/degrading treatment)

    -   Article 6 violation (privilege applies despite \"independent
        existence\")

-   **Exam distinction:**

    -   [x] DNA swab with consent/minor compulsion = acceptable

    -   ✗ Forcing emetic/stomach pumping = violates both Articles 3 & 6

Functional Equivalent: Allan v. UK

> **ALLAN PRINCIPLE:** State cannot circumvent procedural protections by
> using indirect methods (e.g., undercover cellmate to extract
> confession).

-   **Facts:** Police planted fake cellmate after suspect invoked right
    to silence

-   **Holding:** This is \"functional equivalent of police
    interrogation\" → same protections apply

-   State can\'t avoid giving Miranda-type warnings through deceptive
    methods

II\. PUBLIC PROSECUTION SERVICE

The \"Gatekeepers\" Role

**Definition:** Prosecutors are the link between police and court. They
decide whether criminal prosecution takes place and bring cases to
court.

-   **Why \"gatekeepers\"?** They hold the key to the courtroom door

-   They decide who gets prosecuted

-   Without prosecutor\'s decision to prosecute → no trial, no
    conviction possible

Why This Power is Crucial

> **KEY INSIGHT:** The decision to prosecute is arguably MORE powerful
> than the judge\'s sentencing decision, because without prosecution,
> there is no case at all.

Fascinating Comparative Aspect

**How prosecutorial power is organized tells you about:**

-   History and culture of the legal system

-   Trust/confidence in state institutions

-   Balance between individual rights and state power

*Examples:*

-   Netherlands: Prosecutors have substantial power

-   Other countries: Prosecutorial power kept to minimum

III\. MONTESQUIEU & SEPARATION OF POWERS

Historical Context

-   **Montesquieu** (Charles-Louis de Secondat) - French lawyer,
    17th-18th century

-   Studied at University of Bordeaux

-   **Book:** *The Spirit of the Laws* (1748)

-   **Problem he observed:** Absolute monarchies with arbitrary state
    power, torture, no checks on authority

The Three Branches of Government

**1. LEGISLATIVE BRANCH**

-   **Function:** Creates the laws

-   Examples: Parliament, Congress, Legislature

-   Represents the people

**2. EXECUTIVE BRANCH**

-   **Function:** Enforces the laws

-   Examples: Government, ministries, police forces, administrative
    agencies

-   Implements what legislature decided

**3. JUDICIAL BRANCH**

-   **Function:** Interprets and applies the laws

-   Examples: Courts and judges

-   Must be INDEPENDENT from other branches

Why Separation is Essential

> **CORE PRINCIPLE:** These three branches must be SEPARATED to prevent
> concentration of power, which leads to arbitrary use and abuse.

-   Goal: Clarity, stability, and good balance

-   Avoid arbitrariness (what ECHR also wants to avoid)

Judicial Independence = Most Crucial

**Why most important?**

-   Judiciary must be independent to check whether other branches follow
    their own rules

-   **Rule of Law:** State must adhere to its own rules

-   Protects individual rights against state power

Checks and Balances

Powers must not only be separated but also **in balance**

-   Each branch can check the others

-   No branch becomes too powerful

-   Dynamic equilibrium

IV\. THE PROSECUTION PUZZLE

> **❓ THE PUZZLE:** Where should the prosecution service be positioned?
> Are they EXECUTIVE or JUDICIARY?

Arguments for EXECUTIVE

-   Prosecutors **enforce** criminal law (executive function)

-   Work with police (executive agencies)

-   Represent state authority

-   Part of government structure

Arguments for JUDICIARY

-   Prosecutors **evaluate evidence** (judicial function)

-   Act as **magistrates** with objectivity

-   Make **quasi-judicial decisions** (prosecute or not)

-   In civil law: often considered \"standing magistrate\"

-   Exercise judgment, not just ministerial functions

Why This Matters

**Different positioning = Different consequences:**

**[If Executive:]{.underline}**

-   Subject to government direction (political accountability)

-   Less independence

-   Concerns about political prosecutions

-   BUT: Democratic accountability

**[If Judiciary:]{.underline}**

-   Independent from government

-   Cannot receive instructions

-   More protection against political interference

-   BUT: Concerns about accountability (who checks prosecutors?)

> **THE TENSION:** Want independence (protect from political abuse) AND
> accountability (prevent prosecutorial abuse). Hard to have both
> perfectly.

Different National Solutions

*As lecturer noted: \"Different states solve this puzzle differently.
They\'ve created different solutions.\"*

**Examples (to be explored further in lecture):**

-   Netherlands: Prosecutors have broad powers

-   Germany: Prosecutors as part of judiciary

-   France: Investigating judges

-   England: Crown Prosecution Service (more executive)

V. KEY TERMS GLOSSARY

> Within approximately 4 days of arrest

**In Accordance with Law:**

> State interference must have legal basis that is accessible,
> foreseeable, and of sufficient quality

**Proportionality:**

> State interference must be proportionate to legitimate aim; not
> excessive

**Privilege Against Self-Incrimination:**

> Right not to be compelled to provide evidence against yourself

**Functional Equivalent of Interrogation:**

> interrogation protections

**Gatekeeper:**

> Prosecutor\'s role - they \"hold the key\" to the courtroom and decide
> who enters

**Public Prosecutor:**

> State official who decides whether to prosecute and brings cases to
> court; acts in public interest

**Separation of Powers:**

> Division of state authority into legislative, executive, and judicial
> branches to prevent concentration and abuse

**Rule of Law:**

> one is above the law

**Checks and Balances:**

> System where each branch of government can check/limit the others to
> maintain balance

**Judicial Independence:**

> Judges must be free from interference by other branches to ensure fair
> justice and uphold rule of law

VI\. EXAM STRATEGY

Article-by-Article Checklist

**For Article 5 (Liberty) Questions:**

4.  Is there detention/arrest?

5.  Is it for a permitted reason under Article 5(1)?

6.  Was person brought promptly before judge (\~4 days)?

7.  Is pretrial detention reasonable in length given case complexity?

**For Article 8 (Privacy) Questions:**

8.  Is there interference with private life/home/correspondence?

9.  Is it \"in accordance with law\"? (legal basis? accessible?
    foreseeable? sufficient quality?)

10. Is it for legitimate aim (Article 8(2))?

11. Is it proportionate/necessary?

Common Mistakes to Avoid

-   ❌ Forgetting ECHR rights apply at investigation stage, not just
    trial

-   ❌ Confusing domestic law classification with ECHR classification
    (remember *Öztürk* autonomous interpretation)

-   ❌ Not analyzing \"quality of law\" for Article 8 (must check if
    accessible, foreseeable, sufficient quality)

-   ❌ Forgetting the *Jalloh* exception (check HOW evidence was
    obtained)

-   ❌ Not considering proportionality (even if lawful and for
    legitimate aim, must still be proportionate)

Key Phrases for Exam Answers

**Article 5:**

> *\"The starting point is that everyone has the right to liberty\...\"*

**Article 8:**

> *\"Following Niemietz, \'home\' is interpreted broadly to
> include\...\"*
>
