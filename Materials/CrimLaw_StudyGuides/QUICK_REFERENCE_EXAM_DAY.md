# 🎯 CRIMINAL LAW EXAM - QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
*Last-Minute Review Sheet - January 21, 2026*

## ⚡ PART A: THE ESSENTIALS

### Tripartite Framework (MEMORIZE THIS!)

```
STAGE 1: LEGAL ELEMENTS
  ├─ ACTUS REUS (act + result + causation)
  └─ MENS REA (intent or negligence)
  ❌ ANY missing → STOP (No liability)

STAGE 2: UNLAWFULNESS  
  └─ JUSTIFICATIONS: Self-defense | Necessity | State order
  ✅ Justified → STOP (No liability)

STAGE 3: CULPABILITY
  └─ EXCUSES: Duress | Insanity | Provocation | Mistake | Intoxication
  ✅ Excused → STOP (No liability)

NO STOPS → CRIMINAL LIABILITY ✓
```

### Self-Defense (7 Criteria - ALL Must Be Met)

1. ✓ Defense of **legitimate interests** (life, body, property, others)
2. ✓ Attack is **imminent** (happening now or about to happen)
3. ✓ Attack is **unlawful**
4. ✓ Defense is **necessary** (no reasonable alternative)
5. ✓ Defense is **proportionate** (reasonable force)
6. ✓ **Subjective element** (belief attack is occurring)
7. ✓ **No prior fault** (didn't provoke it)

### Causation (2 Steps)

**Step 1: Factual Causation (But-For Test)**  
"But for D's act, would result have occurred when and as it did?"
- NO → Proceed to Step 2
- YES → No liability

**Step 2: Legal Causation**  
Can result be legally attributed despite intervening cause?
- Foreseeable natural event → Usually YES
- High intent (dolus) → Consequences "never too remote"
- Highly culpable third party → Usually NO (breaks chain)
- Unforeseeable victim conduct → Usually NO
- Victim predisposition → Usually YES (thin skull rule)

### Mens Rea Hierarchy (Highest to Lowest)

1. **Direct Intent** - Purpose/aim to cause result
2. **Indirect Intent** - Necessary consequence of purposeful act
3. **Dolus Eventualis** - Consciously accepting risk (NL/DE: intent; other systems: recklessness)
4. **Conscious Negligence** - Aware of risk but think can avoid
5. **Unconscious Negligence** - Should have been aware of risk

---

## ⚡ PART B: THE ESSENTIALS

### Engel Criteria (Is it "Criminal"?)

From **Öztürk v. Germany** - Alternative test (any one sufficient):

1. **Classification** - What does domestic law call it?
2. **Nature** - What legal interests protected?
3. **Severity** - How serious is penalty?

### Article 6 ECHR Fair Trial Rights

**6(1)**: Fair + public hearing by independent, impartial tribunal  
**6(2)**: Presumption of innocence  
**6(3)**: Minimum defense rights

**Key Principles:**
- Applies to **pre-trial** proceedings (Salduz)
- **Overall fairness** assessment
- Privilege against **self-incrimination**
- Right to **remain silent**
- Right to **lawyer from first interrogation**

### Salduz Test (Right to Lawyer)

**Rule**: Access to lawyer required from **first interrogation**

**Exceptions?** Only if:
- Compelling reasons exist, AND
- Did not irreparably prejudice defense rights, AND
- Overall proceedings remained fair

**Statements without lawyer?**
- Generally inadmissible
- Assess: Could defendant challenge later?
- Consider: Overall fairness of proceedings

### Jalloh/Gäfgen (Evidence from Art. 3 Violation)

**Art. 3 Categories** (ascending severity):
1. Degrading treatment
2. Inhuman treatment  
3. Torture

**Evidence Rules:**
- **Torture** → ALWAYS inadmissible (automatic Art. 6 violation)
- **Inhuman/degrading** → Inadmissible if decisive for conviction
- Assess: Overall fairness of proceedings

**Jalloh**: Forced emetics for drugs = degrading + unfair trial  
**Gäfgen**: Threat of pain = torture BUT no Art. 6 violation (conviction based on untainted confession)

### Schatschaschwili Test (Absent Witnesses)

**Three-Step Interrelated Test for Art. 6(3)(d):**

#### Step 1: Good Reason for Non-Attendance?
- Death, fear, untraceable?
- Did state make reasonable efforts?

#### Step 2: Sole or Decisive Evidence?
- Could convict without it?
- Not rigid exclusion rule
- Greater decisiveness → stronger counterbalancing needed

#### Step 3: Counterbalancing Factors?
- Could defendant challenge reliability?
- Opportunity at pre-trial stage?
- Procedural safeguards?
- Corroboration?
- Judicial scrutiny?

**CRITICAL**: Steps are **interrelated** - assess overall fairness holistically!

## 📝 IRAC STRUCTURE

```
I - ISSUE
  "The issue is whether [D] is liable for [offense]."

R - RULE  
  State legal framework/test
  Part A: Tripartite framework + offense elements
  Part B: ECHR article + case law test

A - APPLICATION
  Apply rule to facts step-by-step
  Address each element systematically
  Consider counterarguments
  ← LONGEST SECTION

C - CONCLUSION
  "Therefore, [D] is/is not liable..."
```

## 🎓 CRITICAL CASE HOLDINGS (MEMORIZE!)

### Week 1-2
**Öztürk v. Germany** → Engel criteria for "criminal charge"  
**Venditelli v. Italy** → [ECHR application scope]

### Week 3 (MOST IMPORTANT)
**Salduz v. Turkey** (2008)  
→ Right to lawyer from **first interrogation**  
→ Pre-trial stage = crucial for trial framework

**Jalloh v. Germany** (2006)  
→ Forced emetics = degrading treatment  
→ Evidence inadmissible → unfair trial

**Gäfgen v. Germany** (2010)  
→ Threat of torture violated Art. 3  
→ BUT no Art. 6 violation (evidence excluded, conviction on untainted confession)

### Week 5
**De Cubber v. Belgium** → Impartial tribunal (objective + subjective test)  
**Colozza v. Italy** → Trial in absentia limits

### Week 6
**Schatschaschwili v. Germany** (2015)  
→ Refined Al-Khawaja test  
→ 3-step **interrelated** assessment for absent witnesses

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **DON'T**:
