CRIMINAL LAW PART B

**Week 6: Trial Proceedings & Testimonial Evidence**

*Lecture Notes & Case Law*

IMMEDIACY PRINCIPLE

-   **Requires that the court base its judgment primarily on evidence
    that is presented and/or discussed at the trial**

Definition

-   The immediacy principle concerns the relationship between evidence
    discussed in the courtroom and what appears in the final judgment

-   Creates direct connection: what judge sees/hears → what appears in
    verdict

Two Interpretations

Substantive (Content-Based) Interpretation

-   ALL evidence must literally be brought into the courtroom

-   Judge must see witnesses directly (assess body language, demeanor,
    credibility)

-   Rationale: Best evidence - allows proper assessment of witness
    reliability

-   Used in: Common law systems (with juries), many continental European
    systems

Formal (Procedural) Interpretation

-   Evidence must be discussed in courtroom but doesn\'t need physical
    presence

-   Pre-trial statements can be used instead of live testimony

-   Rationale: Efficiency - first statement after crime may be most
    reliable (fresh memory)

-   Saves time and resources in trial organization

-   **Used in: Netherlands (but has led to multiple ECHR violations)**

**⚠️ Important:** We don\'t know which interpretation produces
\'better\' justice - different systems choose different approaches based
on values and practical considerations.

TYPES OF EVIDENCE

Physical Evidence

1.  Forensic and technical evidence (DNA, fingerprints, digital data -
    increasingly AI-selected)

2.  Instruments of crime (weapons, tools used in offense)

3.  Proceeds of crime (stolen goods, illegal profits)

4.  Medical reports (autopsy results, injury documentation)

5.  Documentary evidence (contracts, receipts, business records, emails)

6.  Etc. (photographs, video recordings, audio recordings)

Testimonial Evidence

7.  Victim (direct testimony about what happened)

8.  Eyewitness (third-party observations of events)

9.  Co-conspirator (accomplice testimony)

10. Informant (undercover or confidential sources)

11. Defendant (confession / alibi / or exercise right to silence)

12. Expert (behavioral scientists, psychologists, technical specialists)

**⚠️ Critical Note on Witness Evidence:** Witness evidence is inherently
unreliable. Memory fades, details get confused, people misremember. This
is why the right to question witnesses is so fundamental - it allows
defense to challenge credibility.

Legal Evidence Requirement

-   **For evidence to be valid, it must respect the law and be within
    the rule of law**

-   Must be obtained in accordance with domestic law, European law, and
    international law

-   Illegally obtained evidence cannot be used, regardless of case
    seriousness

-   Connects to rule of law principle: State authorities must respect
    their own laws

THE RIGHT TO EXAMINE WITNESSES

-   **Article 6(3)(d) ECHR**

**Article 6(3)(d):** *\"Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the
following minimum rights: (d) to examine or have examined witnesses
against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on
his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him.\"*

The Problem: Witnesses That Can\'t Be Heard in Court

1\. \"Precious Witnesses\" (Anonymous Witnesses)

-   Undercover agents who must remain anonymous for operational
    effectiveness

-   Confidential informants working in ongoing investigations

-   Identity disclosure would compromise future operations or safety

-   Used in fight against organized crime, drug trafficking, terrorism

2\. Intimidated Witnesses

-   Must remain anonymous due to fear of accused or associates

-   Fear of retaliation or revenge

-   Willingness to testify compromised by concerns about personal safety

-   Identity protection necessary to secure testimony

3\. Vulnerable Witnesses

-   Need protection due to psychological vulnerability

-   Examples: Victims of sexual offenses, children, trauma survivors

-   Cannot be confronted with accused without severe psychological harm

-   Appearance in court would cause massive trauma or re-traumatization

-   Tension: Suspect\'s right to confront vs. victim protection
    (positive obligations)

4\. Absent Witnesses

-   Cannot appear in court for other reasons

-   Examples: Deceased, severely ill, abroad and unreachable

-   May have given valuable pre-trial statement before becoming
    unavailable

-   **THIS is the main focus of Shachatsvili v. Germany**

SHACHATSVILI v. GERMANY

**⭐ CRITICAL CASE FOR EXAM - GRAND CHAMBER JUDGMENT ⭐**

Background: The Al-Khawaja Test (Three Steps)

-   **Developed in Al-Khawaja & Tahery v. UK**

-   **Refined and clarified in Shachatsvili v. Germany (Grand Chamber)**

-   Addresses the question: When can pre-trial statements be used when
    witness is absent?

The Three-Step Test

13. **Good reasons for non-attendance?**

14. **Sole or decisive evidence?**

15. **Counterbalancing factors?**

Starting Point (Critical Foundation)

-   **Use of statements made during pre-trial stage of criminal
    proceedings is NOT inconsistent with Art. 6(1) and 6(3)(d) ECHR,
    [provided that the rights of the defendant are
    respected]{.underline}**

-   The proceedings as a whole must be fair

-   Pre-trial statements can be used IF proper safeguards are in place

STEP 1: Was There a Good Reason for Non-Attendance?

What Constitutes a \"Good Reason\"?

-   Death of witness

-   Severe illness preventing travel/appearance

-   Witness abroad and unreachable (provided sufficient efforts to
    locate)

-   Intimidation/fear of retaliation

-   Vulnerability (would suffer psychological trauma)

-   Need for anonymity (undercover agents, informants)

Key Clarification from Shachatsvili

-   **Absence of good reason does NOT automatically render trial
    unfair** - but it is a very important factor in overall assessment

-   Unreachability CAN be good reason if authorities made sufficient
    efforts to find witness

-   Must show: summoning attempts, offers to cover travel/accommodation
    expenses, etc.

STEP 2: Does Witness Statement Form Sole or Decisive Evidence?

Definitions

-   **\"Sole\" =** The ONLY evidence in the case against accused

-   **\"Decisive\" =** Evidence of such importance that it is likely to
    determine the outcome of the case

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   = \"Key evidence\" or \"key witness\"

-   Evidence that carries such weight that conviction highly depends on
    it

Key Clarifications from Shachatsvili

-   **Counterbalancing factors needed even when NOT sole/decisive** - if
    evidence has \"significant weight\"

-   **The MORE important the witness statement → the MORE emphasis on
    counterbalancing factors**

-   Court must assess the actual weight of evidence in context of entire
    case

STEP 3: Are There Sufficient Counterbalancing Factors?

-   **Including measures that permit a fair and proper assessment of the
    reliability of that evidence to take place (procedural safeguards)**

What Are Counterbalancing Factors?

Procedural safeguards that compensate for the handicap placed on the
defense by using absent witness statements

Examples of Counterbalancing Factors

16. **Judicial caution:** Court explicitly acknowledges circumstances
    and approaches untested evidence with caution

-   Shows awareness of handicap to defense

-   Attaches appropriate (reduced) weight to untested evidence

17. **Video recording:** Pre-trial statement was recorded and shown in
    court

-   Allows judge/jury to assess demeanor, body language

-   Partially compensates for inability to cross-examine live

18. **Corroborative evidence:** Other evidence supports/confirms absent
    witness\'s statement

-   Shows witness statement is not standing alone

-   Independent verification increases reliability

19. **Defense opportunity to question witness indirectly:** Could submit
    written questions, question through video link, etc.

20. **Defense had opportunity during investigation:** Lawyer present
    when witness questioned by investigating judge/police

-   **THIS WAS CRITICAL IN SHACHATSVILI**

21. **General opportunity to cast doubt on reliability/credibility:**
    Defense must have had SOME opportunity to challenge witness

-   This is FUNDAMENTAL - witness evidence is inherently unreliable

-   Defense must be able to point out inconsistencies, memory problems,
    bias, etc.

Structure of Court\'s Reasoning in Shachatsvili

22. **Recapitulation of the relevant principles (= the Court\'s
    \'Rules\' of IRAC)**

-   **(a) The general principles**

-   = Court\'s development in Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. UK

-   Confirms the three-step test

-   **(b) The relationship between the three steps**

-   = Need to clarify the criteria

-   = Looking at overall assessment model/explanation of abstract
    concepts

-   *(i) With regard to good reason (criterion 1)*

-   Lack of good reason ≠ automatic unfairness (but important factor)

-   *(ii) With regard to counterbalancing factors and sole or decisive
    evidence (criteria 2 and 3)*

-   Counterbalancing needed even when NOT sole/decisive if evidence has
    significant weight

-   More important the evidence → more emphasis on counterbalancing

-   **(c) Principles relating to each of the three steps**

-   = Looking at each individual criterion in detail

-   *(i) Good reason = death, illness, unreachability, intimidation,
    vulnerability, anonymity needs*

-   *(ii) Sole or decisive = only evidence OR evidence likely to
    determine outcome*

-   *(iii) Counterbalancing factors = judicial caution, video recording,
    corroborative evidence, opportunity to question, ability to
    challenge credibility*

23. **Application of these principles to the present case**

-   = The Court\'s \'Analysis\' of IRAC

-   = Application to specific, concrete facts

-   (See working groups for detailed application practice)

Facts of Shachatsvili v. Germany

-   Two violent robberies in Germany (Kassel and Göttingen)

-   Victims in Göttingen: Two Latvian women (Ms. O and Ms. P)

-   Women gave statements to police immediately after robbery

-   Women informed authorities they would return to Latvia within days

-   **Prosecutor requested investigating judge to interrogate women
    before departure**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Purpose: Preserve statements for potential trial use

-   Investigating judge = independent and impartial (not prosecutor)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **CRITICAL PROBLEM: Mr. Shachatsvili not informed of proceedings at
    this time**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   He didn\'t know he was being investigated

-   His lawyer was NOT invited to investigating judge interrogation

-   Prosecutor\'s reasoning: Women traumatized/frightened, informing
    suspect would jeopardize investigation

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Women returned to Latvia after giving statements

-   Mr. Shachatsvili arrested later

-   Court summoned women for trial - they REFUSED to come

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Court made several attempts

-   Offered to pay travel expenses, accommodation

-   Women refused all offers

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   German court decided to read out pre-trial statements at trial

-   Court convicted Shachatsvili - statements were KEY WITNESSES
    (decisive evidence)

-   Court acknowledged: Statements have \"reduced weight\" because made
    in absence of accused

-   But court found: Statements detailed, consistent, coherent → still
    usable

-   Court noted: Women failed to identify Shachatsvili in photo lineup

-   Some corroborative evidence existed

ECtHR Analysis: Application of Three-Step Test

Step 1: Was there a good reason for absence?

**✓ YES** - German courts made sufficient efforts to locate and summon
witnesses. They were unreachable despite these efforts. Unreachability
can be good reason if authorities tried hard enough.

Step 2: Was it sole or decisive evidence?

**DECISIVE (not sole)** - There was other evidence, BUT the women were
KEY WITNESSES. Their testimony was crucial to conviction. Court
\"primarily relied\" on their statements.

Step 3: Sufficient counterbalancing factors?

**✗ NO - INSUFFICIENT** - The critical problem: Mr. Shachatsvili had NO
OPPORTUNITY AT ALL to examine the witnesses at any stage.

Why Were Counterbalancing Factors Insufficient?

-   He was not informed of proceedings when women gave statements to
    investigating judge

-   His lawyer was not present during investigating judge interrogation

-   He had no opportunity to submit questions in writing

-   No video recording was made

-   He could not question witnesses at trial (they were in Latvia)

-   **Result: ZERO opportunity to examine key witnesses = fundamental
    violation**

Court\'s Conclusion

**VIOLATION of Article 6(1) and 6(3)(d) ECHR**

What Could Germany Have Done Better?

-   Inform Shachatsvili (or at minimum his lawyer) before investigating
    judge interrogation

-   Allow defense lawyer to be present and ask questions during
    investigating judge interrogation

-   Video record the investigating judge interrogation

-   Provide some mechanism for defense to challenge witness credibility

-   **Key lesson: When you know witnesses might not appear at trial,
    prepare counterbalancing measures EARLY**

VERDICTS AND SANCTIONS

*Note: This section was covered briefly - focus exam prep on trial
procedures and absent witnesses.*

Types of Verdicts

Procedural Decisions (Formal)

-   Case ends without answering guilt question

-   Examples: Wrong court, invalid summons, defendant died, suspension
    of prosecution

-   Case may potentially continue later (not always final)

Substantive Decisions

-   Court answers guilt question

-   **Conviction OR Acquittal**

-   **IMPORTANT: Acquittal ≠ proven innocent**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Just means: insufficient evidence OR legal requirements not met

-   Person must be treated as innocent (presumption of innocence)

-   Example: Marco Borsato case (acquitted but conduct may have been
    immoral)

Sanctions

Penalties

-   **Aimed at punishment for general prevention**

-   Examples:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Imprisonment (most serious)

-   Detention (lighter form of imprisonment)

-   Community service / unpaid work

-   Fines

-   Accessory penalties: Deprivation of rights (voting, professional
    rights)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Requirements:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Can only be imposed when there is criminal responsibility

-   Must be proportional to damage caused

Measures

-   **Aimed at promotion of security, safety, restorative justice**

-   Examples:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Confiscation of contraband items / illegal profits

-   Obligation to pay compensation to victim

-   Restoration of situation (undo damage)

-   Entrustment orders (commitment to mental health institution for
    treatment)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Purpose: Different from punishment - focuses on prevention and
    restoration

EXAM PREPARATION TIPS

Key Information

How to Study

24. **Make your own summary**

-   DON\'T trust others\' summaries - they contain errors

-   Professor will make exam questions based on common mistakes in
    circulated summaries

25. **Use SlimStampen for case law**

-   AI-based flashcard system

-   Proven effective for memorization

26. Review lecture slides (will be distributed before exam)

27. Practice with working group questions

28. Complete mock exam on Brightspace

29. **Attend Q&A session: First week of January, Wednesday 9-10am**

Most Common Mistakes (AVOID THESE!)

-   **Writing too little in ANALYSIS section**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   This is where most points are lost!

-   Students state rules correctly, give one fact, then jump to
    conclusion

-   **CORRECT: Go through ALL relevant facts, connect to rules, show
    reasoning**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Not connecting facts to legal rules

-   Jumping to conclusion without reasoning

-   Confusing Article numbers or case names

-   Not using IRAC structure when requested

-   Not reading the question carefully

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Example: \"4 days\" in Brogan = promptly brought before judge, NOT
    max detention time

Professor\'s Message
