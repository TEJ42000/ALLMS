1 COURSE INFORMATION**

**Objectives** Object of this part of the course (part A) is to study
fundamental and universal principles and concepts underlying
*substantive criminal law*. Below, you will find the learning outcomes
for both Part A and Part B.

**Learning outcomes** Students of this course are expected to achieve
three main goals. The first goal is to gain knowledge about the core
concepts of substantive and procedural criminal law, and to gain
knowledge about important ECHR cases regarding the right to a fair
trial, the right to liberty and security and the right to privacy. After
this course, students should be able to answer questions about important
concepts and case law (e.g., define two kinds of omission offences; why
was Art. 6 ECHR violated in Pélissier and Sassi vs. France?). Students
should also become aware of the fact that there are major differences
between criminal law systems and they should be able to answer questions
about those differences (e.g., describe the difference between the
adversarial and the inquisitorial approach). The second goal is to gain
insight into the rationales of important doctrines of substantive and
procedural criminal law. After this course, students should be able to
answer questions related to the underlying reasons of certain legal
doctrines (e.g., discuss the concept of punishment in relation to
hypotheticals). The third and most important goal is to acquire the
ability to apply knowledge about legal doctrines and case law to legal
problems. After this course, students should be able to answer legal
questions about certain hypothetical cases and relate national
proceedings to the standards developed by the ECtHR (e.g., did the
defendant act intentionally with regard to B's death according to German
law?; is this a violation of the defendant's right to be present at the
hearing as mentioned in Art. 6 ECHR?).\
\
The most important aim of the lectures is to explain difficult aspects
of the legal doctrines and case law that are to be studied. The most
important aim of the working groups is to teach students how to apply
legal doctrines and case law to legal problems. Students have to prepare
assignments before the working group. These assignments resemble
questions that might be asked on the exam. During the session, the model
answers will be discussed by the working group teacher so that students
are able to ascertain how well they have mastered the subject so far.

**Overview** Comparative law research shows that criminal law systems
around the world deal with similar subjects and thus more or less with
the same issues. Although, at first sight, every country seems to follow
a path of its own, to a great extent criminal law systems have the same
foundations. The objective of this part of the course is to study these
fundamental and universal principles and concepts. Hypothetical cases
will be used to explain legal doctrines and to explore the moral
foundations of legal rules. The following topics may come up in this
course: the legality principle, theories of punishment, actus reus
(commission versus omission, causation), mens rea (intent versus
negligence), the classification of offences, defences (justifications
and excuses), inchoate offences (attempt and preparation) and
participation.

**Part A and B** The course Criminal law is divided into two separate
parts. Part A is dedicated to *substantive* criminal law, whereas part B
is dedicated to *procedural* criminal law. There will be one single
exam. Half of the grade is based on questions about part A and the other
half of the grade is based on questions about part B. Your final grade
is based on the total number of points (compensation is possible).

The first half of the week is dedicated to Part A (Monday and Tuesday).
The second half of the week is dedicated to Part B (Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday).

There are 6 study weeks; in week 7 there are no classes.

**Teaching method** 2 hours of lecture (6 times) and 2 hours of working
group (6 times). The lectures and the working groups are not mandatory.

> Although it is not mandatory to attend the working groups, it is
> highly advisable. ***Preparation for the working groups is mandatory
> if you elect to attend the working groups.*** Preparation means
> studying the required literature and preparing the questions.

**Assessment** Written exam (essay questions). The exam will be about
part A (substantive criminal law) and part B (procedural criminal law).
The course does not have the possibility to gain a bonus point.
