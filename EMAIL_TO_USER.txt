Subject: You're All Set! How to Access the LLS Study Portal

Hi!

Great news - you've been successfully added to the LLS Study Portal! 🎉

However, your web browser remembers that you were previously denied access. We just need to clear that memory so your browser knows you now have access.

This is very simple - just follow these 5 steps:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 SIMPLE 5-STEP PROCESS:

1. CLOSE YOUR BROWSER
   → Close ALL browser windows completely

2. OPEN A PRIVATE WINDOW
   → Press these keys at the same time:
   
   If you use Chrome or Edge:
   • Windows: Ctrl + Shift + N
   • Mac: Cmd + Shift + N
   
   If you use Safari (Mac):
   • Mac: Cmd + Shift + N
   
   If you use Firefox:
   • Windows: Ctrl + Shift + P
   • Mac: Cmd + Shift + P

3. YOU'LL SEE A SPECIAL DARK WINDOW
   → This means you're in private mode ✓

4. GO TO THE WEBSITE
   → Copy and paste this link into the address bar:
   https://lls-study-portal-sarfwmfd3q-ez.a.run.app

5. LOG IN
   → Click "Login with Google"
   → Choose your email: amberunal13@gmail.com
   → Enter your password
   → You're in! ✓

📱 ON YOUR PHONE?

iPhone/iPad:
1. Open Safari
2. Tap the tabs icon (two squares) at the bottom
3. Tap "Private" in the bottom-left
4. Tap + for a new private tab
5. Go to the website and log in

Android:
1. Open Chrome
2. Tap the 3 dots at the top

❓ QUICK QUESTIONS:

Q: Why do I need to do this?
A: Your browser remembers you were denied before. This clears that memory.

Q: Do I need to do this every time?
A: No! Only this first time. After that, you can use your normal browser.

Q: Is this safe?
A: Yes! Private/Incognito mode is completely safe. It just doesn't save your browsing history.
